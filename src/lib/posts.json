    "content": "\n_Note: For completing this lecture, you might wanna first read through [[Python From Scratch]] and [[Object Oriented Programming in Python]]_\n\n### what is functional programming ?\n\n- Functional programming is a style (or \"paradigm\" if you're pretentious) of programming where we compose functions instead of mutating state (updating the value of variables).\n\n- [Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) is more about declaring *what* you want to happen, rather than *how* you want it to happen.\n- [Imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming) (or procedural) programming declares both the *what* and the *how*.\n\n- **Example of imperative code:**\n\n```python\ncar = create_car()\ncar.add_gas(10)\ncar.clean_windows()\n```\n\n- **Example of functional code:**\n\n```python\nreturn clean_windows(add_gas(create_car()))\n```\n\n- In the functional example, we never change the value of the `car` variable, we just compose functions that return new values, with the outermost function, `clean_windows` in this case, returning the final result.\n\n### Python is not the best for functional programming:\n\n- Python is *not* the best language for functional programming. Reasons include:\n\n1. No [static typing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Static_typing).\n2. Everything is [mutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object).\n3. No [tail call optimization](https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_tail-calls.html).\n4. [Side effects](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side_effect_(computer_science)>) are common.\n5. Imperative and OOP styles abound in popular libraries.\n6. [Purity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) is not enforced (and sometimes not even encouraged).\n7. [Sum Types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type) are hard to define.\n8. [Pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_matching) is weak at best.\n\nSo seriously, why are we using Python?\n\n- cause we already know it\n\n### Immutability:\n\n- In FP, we strive to make data *[immutable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immutable_object)*. Once a value is created, it cannot be changed. *Mutable* data, on the other hand, can be changed after it's created.\n- Why ?\n  - Immutable data is easier to think about and work with. When 10 different functions have access to the same variable, and you're debugging a problem with that variable, you have to consider the possibility that any of those functions could have changed the value.\n  - When a variable is immutable, you can be sure that it hasn't changed since it was created. It's a helluva lot easier to work with.\n- _Generally speaking, immutability means fewer bugs and more maintainable code._\n- Tuples vs Lists\n  - Tuples and lists are both ordered collections of values, but tuples are *immutable* and lists are *mutable*.\n- You can append to a list, but you can *not* append to a tuple. You can create a *new copy* of a tuple using values from an existing tuple, but you can't change the existing tuple.\n- Lists are mutable\n\n```python\nages = [16, 21, 30]\n# 'ages' is being changed in place\nages.append(80)\n# [16, 21, 30, 80]\n```\n\n- Tuples are immutable\n\n```python\nages = (16, 21, 30)\nmore_ages = (80,) # note the comma! It's required for a single-element tuple\n# 'all_ages' is a brand new tuple\nall_ages = ages + more_ages\n# (16, 21, 30, 80)\n```\n\n- Functional programming aims to be *declarative*. We prefer to declare *what* we want the computer to do, rather than muck around with the details of *how* to do it.\n- Declarative Programming:\n  - It does *not* execute line-by-line like an imperative language. Instead, it simply declares the desired style, and it's up to a web browser to figure out how to apply and display it.(CSS)\n- Unlike functional programming (and CSS), a lot of code is *imperative*. We write out the exact step-by-step implementation details. This Python script draws a red button on a screen using the [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) library:\n\n```python\nfrom tkinter import * # first, import the library\nmaster = Tk() # create a window\nmaster.geometry(\"200x100\") # set the window size\nbutton = Button(master, text=\"Submit\", fg=\"red\").pack() # create a button\nmaster.mainloop() # start the event loop\n```\n\n### It's just math:\n\n- Functional programming tends to be popular amongst developers with a strong mathematical background. After all, a math equation isn't procedural: it's declarative. Take the following math equation:\n\n```\n\tavg = Σx/N\n```\n\n- To put this calculation in plain English:\n  1.  `Σ` is just the Greek letter [Sigma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigma), and it represents \"the [sum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation) of a collection\".\n  2.  `x` is the collection of numbers we're averaging.\n  3.  `N` is the number of elements in the collection.\n  4.  `avg` is equal to the sum of all the numbers in collection \"x\" divided by the number of elements in collection \"x\".\n\n- So, the equation really just says that `avg` is the average of all the numbers in collection \"x\". This math equation is a *declarative* way of writing \"calculate the average of a list of numbers\". Here's some *imperative Python code* that does the same thing:\n\n```python\ndef get_average(nums):\n    total = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        total += num\n    return total / len(nums)\n```\n\n- with functional programming, we would write code that's *a bit more* declarative:\n\n```python\ndef get_average(nums):\n    return sum(nums) / len(nums)\n```\n\n### Classes vs Functions:\n\n- I run into new developers who, after learning about classes, want to use them *everywhere*. They assume that because they learned about functions first, functions are somehow inferior.\n- **If you're unsure, default to functions.** I find myself reaching for classes when I need something long-lived and stateful that would be easier to model if I could share behavior *and data structure* via inheritance. This is often the case for:\n  - Video games\n  - Simulations\n  - GUIs\n- The difference is:\n  > **Classes** encourage you to think about the world as a hierarchical collection of objects. Objects bundle behavior, data, and state together in a way that draws boundaries between instances of things, like chess pieces on a board.\n\n> **Functions** encourage you to think about the world as a series of data transformations. Functions take data as input and return a transformed output. For example, a function might take the entire state of a chess board and a move as inputs, and return the new state of the board as output.\n\n### Debugging FP:\n\n- Need to paruse code for debugging.\n\n### Functional vs OOP:\n\n- Functional programming and object-oriented programming are **styles for writing code**. One isn't inherently superior to the other, but to be a well-rounded developer you should understand both well and use ideas from each when appropriate.\n- You'll encounter developers who love functional programming and others who love object-oriented programming. However, contrary to popular opinion, FP and OOP are *not* always at odds with one another. They aren't opposites. Of the four pillars of OOP, [inheritance](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)>) is the only one that doesn't fit with functional programming.\n- Inheritance isn't seen in functional code due to the mutable classes that come along with it. Encapsulation, polymorphism and abstraction are still used all the time in functional programming.\n\n### Functions as Values:\n\n- In Python, functions are just values, like strings, integers, or objects. For example, we can assign an existing function to a variable:\n\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\n# assign the function to a new variable\n# called \"addition\". It behaves the same\n# as the original \"add\" function\naddition = add\nprint(addition(2, 5))\n```\n\n### Anonymous Functions:\n\n- Anonymous functions have *no name*, and in Python, they're called [lambda functions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#lambda) after [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus). Here's a lambda function that takes a single argument `x` and returns the result of `x + 1`:\n\n```python\nlambda x: x + 1\n```\n\n- Notice that the [expression](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html#expressions) `x + 1` is returned *automatically*, no need for a `return` statement. And because functions are just values, we can assign the function to a variable named `add_one`:\n\n```python\nadd_one = lambda x: x + 1\nprint(add_one(2))\n```\n\n- Because they simply return the result of an expression, they're often used for small, simple evaluations. Here's an example that uses a lambda to get a value from a dictionary:\n\n```python\nget_age = lambda name: {\n    \"lane\": 29,\n    \"hunter\": 69,\n    \"allan\": 17\n}.get(name, \"not found\")\nprint(get_age(\"lane\"))\n```\n\n### First Class and Higher Order Functions:\n\n- A programming language \"supports first-class functions\" when functions are treated like any other variable. That means functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, can be returned by other functions, and can be assigned to variables.\n- **First-class function:** A function that is treated like any other value\n- **Higher-order function:** A function that accepts another function as an argument or returns a function\n- Python supports first-class and higher-order functions.\n\n```python\ndef square(x):\n    return x * x\n\n# Assign function to a variable\nf = square\n\nprint(f(5))\n# 25\n```\n\n- Higher Order Example:\n\n```python\ndef square(x):\n    return x * x\n\ndef my_map(func, arg_list):\n    result = []\n    for i in arg_list:\n        result.append(func(i))\n    return result\n\nsquares = my_map(square, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\nprint(squares)\n# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n### Map:\n\n- \"Map\", \"filter\", and \"reduce\" are three commonly used [higher-order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function) in functional programming.\n- In Python, the built-in [map](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#map) function takes a function and an [iterable](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-iterable) (in this case a list) as inputs. It returns an iterator that applies the function to every item, yielding the results.\n- With map, we can operate on lists without using loops and nasty stateful variables.\n\n```python\ndef square(x):\n    return x * x\n\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nsquared_nums = map(square, nums)\nprint(list(squared_nums))\n# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]\n```\n\n- The [list type constructor](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#list), `list()` converts the `map` object back into a standard list.\n\n### Filter:\n\n- The built-in [filter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#filter) function takes a function and an iterable (in this case a list) and returns a *new* iterable that only contains elements from the original iterable where the result of the function on that item returned `True`.\n\n```python\ndef is_even(x):\n    return x % 2 == 0\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\nevens = list(filter(is_even, numbers))\nprint(evens)\n# [2, 4, 6]\n```\n\n### Reduce:\n\n- The built-in [functools.reduce()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.reduce) function takes a function and a list of values, and applies the function to each value in the list, *accumulating a single result* as it goes.\n\n```python\n# import functools from the standard library\nimport functools\n\ndef add(sum_so_far, x):\n    print(f\"sum_so_far: {sum_so_far}, x: {x}\")\n    return sum_so_far + x\n\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]\nsum = functools.reduce(add, numbers)\n# sum_so_far: 1, x: 2\n# sum_so_far: 3, x: 3\n# sum_so_far: 6, x: 4\n# 10 doesn't print, it's just the final result\nprint(sum)\n# 10\n```\n\n### zip:\n\n- [zip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) function takes two iterables (in this case lists), and returns a *new* iterable where each element is a tuple containing one element from each of the original iterables.\n\n```py\na = [1, 2, 3]\nb = [4, 5, 6]\n\nc = list(zip(a, b))\nprint(c)\n# [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]\n```\n\n### Pure Functions:\n\n- If you take nothing else away from this course, *please* take this: **[Pure functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) are fantastic.** They have two properties:\n  - They *always* return the same value given the same arguments.\n  - Running them causes no side effects\n- In short: **pure functions don't do anything with anything that exists outside of their scope.**\n\n```python\ndef find_max(nums):\n\tmax_val = float(\"-inf\")\n\tfor num in nums:\n\t\tif max_val < num:\n\t\t\tmax_val = num\n\treturn max_val\n```\n\n### Reference vs Value:\n\n- When you pass a value into a function as an argument, one of two things can happen:\n  - It's passed by **reference**: The function has access to the original value and can change it\n  - It's passed by **value**: The function only has access to a copy. Changes to the copy within the function don't affect the original\n- There is a bit more nuance, but this explanation mostly works.\n- These types are passed by **reference**:\n  - Lists\n  - Dictionaries\n  - Sets\n- These types are passed by **value**:\n  - Integers\n  - Floats\n  - Strings\n  - Booleans\n  - Tuples\n- Most collection types are passed by reference (except for tuples) and most primitive types are passed by value.\n- Simply assigning a new variable to an existing dictionary doesn't copy that dictionary, it points to the same dictonary. Instead use the [.copy()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/copy.html) method to create a new copy of a dictionary.\n\n### Input and Output:\n\n- The term \"i/o\" stands for input/output. In the context of writing programs, i/o refers to anything in our code that interacts with the \"outside world\". \"Outside world\" just means anything that's not stored in our application's memory (like variables).\n- Examples of I/O:\n  - Reading form or writing to a file on the hard drive.\n  - Accessing the internet\n  - Reading from or writing to a database\n  - Even simply printing to the console is considered i/o.\n- In functional programming, i/o is viewed as *dirty* but *necessary*. We know we can't *eliminate* i/o from our code, so we just *contain* it as much as possible. There should be a clear place in your project that does nasty i/o stuff, and the rest of your code can be pure.\n\n- For example, a Python program might:\n  1.  Read a file from the hard drive as the program starts\n  2.  Run a bunch of pure functions to analyze the data\n  3.  Write the results of the analysis to a file on the hard drive at the end\n\n### No-op:\n\n- A [no-op](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOP_(code)>) is an operation that does... nothing.\n- If a function doesn't return anything, it's probably impure. If it doesn't return anything, the only reason for it to exist is to perform a side effect.\n- This function performs a useless computation because it doesn't return anything or perform a side-effect. It's a no-op.\n\n```python\ndef square(x):\n    x * x\n```\n\n- This function performs a side effect. It changes the value of the `y` variable that is outside of its scope. It's impure.\n\n```python\ny = 5\ndef add_to_y(x):\n    global y\n    y += x\n\nadd_to_y(3)\n# y = 8\n```\n\n- The [`global`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#global) keyword just tells Python to allow access to the outer-scoped `y` variable.\n\n### Memoization:\n\n- At its core, [memoization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) is just [caching](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_(computing)>) (storing a copy of) the result of a computation so that we don't have to compute it again in the future.\n- For example, take this simple function:\n\n```python\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n```\n\n- A call to `add(5, 7)` will *always* evaluate to `12`. So, if you think about it, once we know that `add(5, 7)` can be replaced with `12`, we can just store the value `12` somewhere in memory so that we don't have to do the addition operation again in the future. Then, if we need to `add(5, 7)` again, we can just look up the value `12` instead of doing a (potentially expensive) CPU operation.\n- The slower and more complex the function, the more memoization can help speed things up.\n- _Note: It's pronounced \"memOization\", not \"memORization\". This confused me for quite a while in college, I thought my professor just didn't speak goodly.._\n\n### Referential Transparency:\n\n- Pure functions are always [referentially transparent](https://www.baeldung.com/cs/referential-transparency#referential-transparency).\n- \"Referential transparency\" is a fancy way of saying that a function call can be replaced by its would-be return value because it's the same every time. **Referentially transparent functions can be safely memoized.** For example `add(2, 3)` can be smartly replaced by the value `5`.\n- The great thing about pure functions is that they can always be *safely* memoized. Impure functions can't be because they might do something in addition to returning a static value, or they might return different values given the same arguments.\n- No! Memoization is a *tradeoff* between memory and speed. If your function is fast to execute, it's probably not worth memoizing, because the amount of RAM (memory) your program will need to store the results will go way up.\n- It's also a bunch of extra code to write, so you should only do it if you have a good reason to.\n\n### Recursion:\n\n- [Recursion](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)>) is a famously tricky concept to grasp, but it's honestly quite simple - don't let it intimidate you! A recursive function is just a function that calls itself!\n\n> Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.\n\n- If you thought loops were the only way to iterate over a list, you were wrong! Recursion is fundamental to functional programming because it's how we iterate over lists while avoiding stateful loops. Take a look at this function that sums the numbers in a list:\n\n```python\ndef sum_nums(nums):\n    if len(nums) == 0:\n        return 0\n    return nums[0] + sum_nums(nums[1:])\n\nprint(sum_nums([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))\n# 15\n```\n\n- Steps: - Solve a small problem : - Our goal is to sum all the numbers in a list, but we're not allowed to loop. So, we start by solving the smallest possible problem: summing the first number in the list with the rest of the list:\n\n      \t```python\n\n  return nums[0] + sum_nums(nums[1:])\n\n  ```\n\n      - Recurse   :\n      \t- So, what actually happens when we call `sum_nums(nums[1:])`? Well, we're just calling `sum_nums` with a smaller list! In the first call, the `nums` input was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, but in the next call it's just `[2, 3, 4, 5]`. We just keep calling `sum_nums` with smaller and smaller lists.\n      - The base case :\n      \t- So what happens when we get to the \"end\"? `sum_nums(nums[1:])` is called, but `nums[1:]` is an empty list because we ran out of numbers. We need to write a base case to stop the madness.\n  ```\n\n```python\nif len(nums) == 0:\n    return 0\n```\n\n- recursively add the size of the items of a fs clone:\n\n```python\ndef sum_nested_list(lst):\n    total_size = 0\n    for item in lst:\n        if isinstance(item,int):\n            total_size += item\n        else:\n            total_size += sum_nested_list(item)\n    return total_size\n```\n\n- Recursion is *so dang useful* with tree-like structures because we don't always know how deep they're nested. Stop and think about how you would write nested loops to traverse a tree of arbitrary depth... it's not easy, is it?\n\n### Dangers of Recursion:\n\n- Recursion is great because it's simple and elegant, often being the most straightforward way to solve a problem. But there are some things to watch out for:\n  1.  **Stack Overflow**: Each function call requires a bit of memory. So, if you recurse too deeply, you can run out of [\"stack\" memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack-based_memory_allocation) which will crash your program. (This is what the famous [website](https://stackoverflow.com/) is named after)\n  2.  If you don't have a solid base case, you can end up in an infinite loop (which will likely lead to a stack overflow).\n  3.  Recursion (especially in a language like Python) is often slower than a `for` loop because each function call requires some memory. [Tail call optimization](https://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_tail-calls.html) can help with this, but Python doesn't support it.\n  - Recursive String Reversal:\n\n```python\n\tdef recurse_reverse_string(s,k):\n    if k < 1:\n        return ''\n    rev_string = \"\"\n    if k == 1:\n        return s[0]\n    else:\n        return s[k-1] + recurse_reverse_string(s,k-1)\n\tdef reverse_string(s):\n\t    return recurse_reverse_string(s,len(s))\n```\n\n### Function Transformations:\n\n- \"Function transformation\" is just a more concise way to describe a specific type of [higher order function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function). It's when a function takes a function (or functions) as input and returns a *new* function.\n\n```python\ndef multiply(x, y):\n    return x * y\n\ndef add(x, y):\n    return x + y\n\n# self_math is a higher order function\n# input: a function that takes two arguments and returns a value\n# output: a new function that takes one argument and returns a value\ndef self_math(math_func):\n    def inner_func(x):\n        return math_func(x, x)\n    return inner_func\n\nsquare_func = self_math(multiply)\ndouble_func = self_math(add)\n\nprint(square_func(5))\n# prints 25\n\nprint(double_func(5))\n# prints 10\n```\n\n- Why Function Transformations:\n  - \"When would I use function transformations in the real world?\"\n  - \"Isn't it simpler to just define functions at the top level of the code, and call them as needed?\"\n\n- Good questions. To be clear, we don't just transform functions at [runtime](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Execution_(computing)#Runtime>) for the fun of it! We only use advanced techniques like function transformations when they make our code *simpler than it would otherwise be*.\n\n### Code Reusability\n\n- Creating variations of the same function dynamically can make it a lot easier to share common functionality. Take a look at this `formatter` function. It accepts a \"pattern\" and returns a new function that formats text according to that pattern:\n\n```python\ndef formatter(pattern):\n    def inner_func(text):\n        result = \"\"\n        i = 0\n        while i < len(pattern):\n            if pattern[i:i+2] == '{}':\n                result += text\n                i += 2\n            else:\n                result += pattern[i]\n                i += 1\n        return result\n    return inner_func\n```\n\n- Now we can create new formatters easily:\n\n```python\nbold_formatter = formatter(\"**{}**\")\nitalic_formatter = formatter(\"*{}*\")\nbullet_point_formatter = formatter(\"* {}\")\n```\n\n- And use them like this:\n\n```python\nprint(bold_formatter(\"Hello\"))\n# **Hello**\nprint(italic_formatter(\"Hello\"))\n# *Hello*\nprint(bullet_point_formatter(\"Hello\"))\n# * Hello\n```\n\n### Closures:\n\n- A [closure](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)>) is a function that references variables from outside its own function body. The function definition *and its environment* are bundled together into a single entity.\n- Put simply, a closure is just a function that **keeps track of some values** from the place where it was *defined*, no matter where it is executed later on.\n\n```python\ndef concatter():\n\tdoc = \"\"\n\tdef doc_builder(word):\n\t\t# \"nonlocal\" tells Python to use the 'doc'\n\t\t# variable from the enclosing scope\n\t\tnonlocal doc\n\t\tdoc += word + \" \"\n\t\treturn doc\n\treturn doc_builder\n\n# save the returned 'doc_builder' function\n# to the new function 'harry_potter_aggregator'\nharry_potter_aggregator = concatter()\nharry_potter_aggregator(\"Mr.\")\nharry_potter_aggregator(\"and\")\nharry_potter_aggregator(\"Mrs.\")\nharry_potter_aggregator(\"Dursley\")\nharry_potter_aggregator(\"of\")\nharry_potter_aggregator(\"number\")\nharry_potter_aggregator(\"four,\")\nharry_potter_aggregator(\"Privet\")\n\nprint(harry_potter_aggregator(\"Drive\"))\n# Mr. and Mrs. Dursley of number four, Privet Drive\n```\n\n- Python has a keyword called [nonlocal](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#nonlocal) that's required to modify a variable from an enclosing scope. Most programming languages don't require this keyword, but Python does.\n- The whole point of a closure is that it's *stateful*. It's a function that \"remembers\" the values from the enclosing scope even after the enclosing scope has finished executing.\n- It's as if you're saving the state of a function at a particular point in time, and then you can use and update that state later on.\n- When not to use the `nonlocal` keyword: when the variable is mutable (such as a list, dictionary or set), and you are modifying its contents rather than reassigning the variable. You only need the `nonlocal` keyword if you are reassigning a variable instead of modifying its contents (which you must do to change immutable values such as strings and integers).\n\n### Currying:\n\n- Function [currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) is a specific *kind* of function transformation where we translate a single function that accepts multiple arguments into *multiple* functions that each accept a *single* argument.\n\n```python\ndef sum(a):\n  def inner_sum(b):\n    return a + b\n  return inner_sum\n\nprint(sum(1)(2))\n# prints 3\n```\n\n- The `sum` function only takes a *single* input, `a`. It returns a *new* function that takes a single input, `b`. This new function when called with a value for `b` will return the sum of `a` and `b`. *We'll talk later about why this is useful.*\n\n### Why Curry ?\n\n- Well, currying is often used to **change a function's signature** to make it conform to a specific shape. For example:\n\n```python\ndef colorize(converter, doc):\n  # ...\n  converter(doc)\n  # ...\n```\n\n- `colorize` function accepts a function called `converter` as input, and at some point during its execution, it calls `converter` with a single argument. That means that it expects `converter` to accept exactly one argument. So, if I have a conversion function like this:\n\n```python\ndef markdown_to_html(doc, asterisk_style):\n  # ...\n```\n\n- I can't pass `markdown_to_html` to `colorize` because `markdown_to_html` wants *two* arguments. To solve this problem, I can curry `markdown_to_html` into a function that takes a single argument:\n\n```python\ndef markdown_to_html(asterisk_style):\n  def asterisk_md_to_html(doc):\n    # do stuff with doc and asterisk_style...\n\n  return asterisk_md_to_html\n\nmarkdown_to_html_italic = markdown_to_html('italic')\ncolorize(markdown_to_html_italic, doc)\n```\n\n### Decorators:\n\n- [Python decorators](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/decorators.html) are just [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) for [higher-order functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function).\n\n```python\ndef vowel_counter(func_to_decorate):\n    vowel_count = 0\n    def wrapper(doc):\n        nonlocal vowel_count\n        vowels = \"aeiou\"\n        for char in doc:\n            if char in vowels:\n                vowel_count += 1\n        print(f\"Vowel count: {vowel_count}\")\n        return func_to_decorate(doc)\n    return wrapper\n\n@vowel_counter\ndef process_doc(doc):\n    print(f\"Document: {doc}\")\n\nprocess_doc(\"What\")\n# Vowel count: 1\n# Document: What\n\nprocess_doc(\"a wonderful\")\n# Vowel count: 5\n# Document: a wonderful\n\nprocess_doc(\"world\")\n# Vowel count: 6\n# Document: world\n```\n\n- `@vowel_counter` line is \"decorating\" the `process_doc` function with the `vowel_counter` function. `vowel_counter` is called once when `process_doc` is defined with the `@` syntax, but the `wrapper` function that it returns is called every time `process_doc` is called. That's why `vowel_count` is preserved and printed after each time.\n- Python decorators are just another (sometimes simpler) way of writing a higher-order function. These two pieces of code are *identical*:\n- With Decorator\n\n```python\n@vowel_counter\ndef process_doc(doc):\n    print(f\"Document: {doc}\")\n\nprocess_doc(\"Something wicked this way comes\")\n```\n\n- Without decorator\n\n```python\ndef process(doc):\n    print(f\"Document: {doc}\")\n\nprocess_doc = vowel_counter(process)\nprocess_doc(\"Something wicked this way comes\")\n```\n\n### Args and Kwargs:\n\n- In Python, [`*args` and `**kwargs`](https://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/args_and_kwargs.html) allow a function to accept and deal with a *variable* number of arguments.\n  - `*args` collects positional arguments into a *tuple*\n  - `**kwargs` collects keyword (named) arguments into a *dictionary*\n\n```python\ndef print_arguments(*args, **kwargs):\n    print(f\"Positional arguments: {args}\")\n    print(f\"Keyword arguments: {kwargs}\")\n\nprint_arguments(\"hello\", \"world\", a=1, b=2)\n# Positional arguments: ('hello', 'world')\n# Keyword arguments: {'a': 1, 'b': 2}\n```\n\n- Positional arguments are the ones you're already familiar with, where the order of the arguments matters. Like this:\n\n```python\ndef sub(a, b):\n    return a - b\n\n# a=3, b=2\nres = sub(3, 2)\n# res = 1\n```\n\n- [Keyword arguments](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments) are passed in by name. *Order does not matter*. Like this:\n\n```python\ndef sub(a, b):\n    return a - b\n\nres = sub(b=3, a=2)\n# res = -1\nres = sub(a=3, b=2)\n# res = 1\n```\n\n- Any positional arguments *must come before* keyword arguments. This will *not* work:\n\n```python\nsub(b=3, 2)\n```\n\n```python\ndef args_logger(*args, **kwargs):\n    # ?\n    counter = 1\n    for args in args:\n        print(f\"{counter}. {args}\")\n        counter += 1\n    for key in sorted(kwargs.keys()):\n        print(f\"* {key}: {kwargs[key]}\")\n```\n\n- The `*args` and `**kwargs` syntax is great for decorators that are intended to work on functions with different [signatures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Signature/Function).\n- The `log_call_count` function below doesn't care about the number or type of the decorated function's (`func_to_decorate`) arguments. It just wants to count how many times the function is called. However, it still needs to pass any arguments through to the wrapped function.\n\n```python\ndef log_call_count(func_to_decorate):\n    count = 0\n\n    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):\n        nonlocal count\n        count += 1\n        print(f\"Called {count} times\")\n        # The * and ** syntax unpacks the arguments\n        # and passes them to the decorated function\n        return func_to_decorate(*args, **kwargs)\n    return wrapper\n```\n\n### Enums:\n\n- Doing the admittedly weird `class` and `isinstance()` thing works, but it turns out, there's a better way in some cases. If you're trying to represent a fixed set of values (but not store additional data within them) [enums](https://docs.python.org/3/library/enum.html) are the way to go.\n\n```python\nfrom enum import Enum\n\nColor = Enum('Color', ['RED', 'GREEN', 'BLUE'])\nprint(Color.RED)  # this works, prints 'Color.RED'\nprint(Color.TEAL) # this raises an exception\n```\n\n- Unfortunately, Python does *not* support sum types as well as some of the other [statically typed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Static_typing) languages.\n- Python [does not enforce](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) your types before your code runs. That's why we need this line here to `raise` an `Exception` if a color is invalid:\n\n```python\ndef color_to_hex(color):\n    if color == Color.GREEN:\n        return '#00FF00'\n    elif color == Color.BLUE:\n        return '#0000FF'\n    elif color == Color.RED:\n        return '#FF0000'\n    # handle the case where the color is invalid\n    raise Exception('Unknown color')\n```\n\n### Match stmt:\n\n- Python has a `match` statement that tends to be a lot cleaner than a series of `if/else/elif` statements when we're working with a fixed set of possible values (like a sum type, or more specifically an enum):\n\n```python\ndef get_hex(color):\n    match color:\n        case Color.RED:\n            return \"#FF0000\"\n        case Color.GREEN:\n            return \"#00FF00\"\n        case Color.BLUE:\n            return \"#0000FF\"\n\n        # default case\n        # (invalid Color)\n        case _:\n            return \"#FFFFFF\"\n```\n\n### Functools Module: \n- ref: https://martinheinz.dev/blog/52\n- functool module offers many useful higher order functions that act on or return other functions, which we can leverage to implement function caching, overloading, creating decorators and in general to make our code much more functional.\n- experiments: https://github.com/sagnikc395/functools-explore\n\n#### Caching :\n- there are caching functions - `lru_cache`, `cache` and `cached_property`.\n- `lru_cache` as the name suggests provides the least recently used cache of function results or in other words - memoization of results.\n- can inspect the cache info of our function using the `cache_info` method and which shows number of cache hits or misses.\n- Decorator also provides a `clear_cache` and a`cache_parameters` methods for invalidating cached results and inspecting parameters respectively.\n- For more granular caching, can pass the parameter `typed=True` argument, which makes it so that arguments of different types are cached separately.\n- Another caching decorator in `functools` is a function simply called `cache`. \n\t- Simple wrapper on top of the `lru_cache` which will omit the `max_size` argument making it smaller and after as it doesn't need to evict old values.\n- `cached_property` decorator \n\t- used for caching the results of class attributes.\n\t- useful if we have property that is expensive to compute while also immutable.\n\t- Use Case: cache rendered HTML page which would get returned to user over-and-over again. Same could be done for certain database queries or long mathematical computation.\n\t- only runs on lookups, therefore allowing us to modify the attribute.\n\t- after the attribute is modified, the previously cached value won't be used , instead new value will be computed and cached.\n#### comparing and ordering:\n - luckily, functools, module includes `@total_ordering` decorator that can help us with that. - all we need to do , is implement `__eq__` and one of the remaining methods and rest will be automatically providedd by the decorator.\n\n#### partial:\n- many external libraries and frameworks provide functions and interfaces that require us to pass in callback functions.\n- What if we need to also pass in some arguments along with the callback functions.\n\t- thats where `functools.partial` comes in handy - `partial` can be used to freeze some (or all) of the function's arguments, creating new object with simplified function signatures.\n\n",

    "content": "### Typescript and Types of Languages\n- There are various types of languages, there are compiled and loosely typed language.\n- another distinction we can make in languages.\n\t- Eg: Python,JS -> loosely typed languages , C++, Java -> strongly typed language\n- In JS, we not only are able to change the value but also the type.\n\t- In C++ ,it is not allowed, like integer cannot be assigned to integer.\n- Starting out coding, loosely typed projects are easier to learn and there is a lower learning curve and easier to get dopamine hits than statically typed language.\n- In production, however you want very strong type checking and here the compiler will help and let them know if there is a problem with the code.\n\t- Less runtime errors.\n- JS is a great language, but since it doesnt have types , it is not that great for production.\n\t- TS was introduced as a new language to add types on top of JS.\n- Strict syntactical superset of JS that adds type information on top of it.\n- A native JS code , without very strong type checking will almost certainly work with Typescript.\n- How does TS code run ?\n\t- TS code does not work on your browser.\n\t\t- TS never runs at all form line to line, JS is the runtime language.\n\t- TS gets transpiled down to JS.\n\t\t- `typescript -> tsc -> javascript -> {browser,nodejs}`\n\t- it will do all the static checks , this will give a file that will get run in the browser.\n\t- tsc compiler is supposed to ensure that there is no type errors in the code.\n\t- if we have an error in our code, it will fail during compilation.\n- TS easy to catch at compile time , and the code does what it is supposed to do.\n- `tsconfig.json` \n\t- config of our typescript\n\t- `target`\n\t\t- specifies the ECMAScript target version to which the Typescript compiler will compile the Typescript code.\n\t- `rootDir`\n\t\t- where should the compiler look for `.ts` files. Good practice is to keep it in the `src` folder.\n\t- `outDir`\n\t\t- where should the compiler look for spit out `.ts` files.\n\t- `noImplicitAny`\n\t\t- To prevent `any` use on the codebase.\n\t- `removeComments`\n\t\t- Whether or not to include comments in the final `js` file.\n- `tsc -b` command to generate the corresponding js files from the ts files.\n- \"use strict\" is something that makes our code more strict.\n- basic types in typescript:\n\t- Number \n\t- string \n\t- boolean \n\t- null\n\t- undefined \n- Typescript can do type inference \n\t- we dont have to always give it a return type each time , typescript compiler knows and can infer it \n\n### Types and Interfaces:\n- Interfaces \n\t- how to assign types to objects ? \n\t- basically a way to combine multiple things into a single object \n\t- interfaces have another property that we can implement interfaces as a class\n- Types\n\t- very similar to interfaces\n\t- let us aggregate data together \n\t- but they let us do more composable things than interfaces.\n\t- Types cannot be used to implement classes.\n\t- Intersection:\n\t\t- what if we want a type that has every property of multiple `types` and `interfaces`\n\t\t- use an intersection of types for that \n- Diff bw interfaces and types? \n\t- types let us do ors and ands , whereas interfaces let us extend a class.\n\t- interfaces can't express unions, mapped types or conditional types. Type aliases can express any type.\n\t- Interfaces can use extends, types can't.\n\t- When we are working with objects that inherit from each pother, use interfaces. extends makes TS type checker run slightly faster than using &.\n\t- Interfaces with the same name in the same scope merge their declarations leading to unexpected bugs.\n\t- Type aliases have an implicit index signature of `Record<PropertyKey,unknown>` , which comes up occasionally.\n### Arrays in TS\n- If we want to access arrays in TS, simple as adding a annotation next to the type.\n- `number[]`\n- or `Array<number>` \n- both of them works.\n\n\n### Enums\n- Are a feature that allow us to define a level of named constraints.\n- The concept behind enumerations is to create human-readable way to represent a set of constant values , which might otherwise be represented as numbers or strings.\n- evaluated at compile times to check this and let us know the error in advance in the types.\n- something we use when we know that are a limited set of constrained, constant values.\n- the final value stored at runtime is still a number.(default value is 0)\n### Generics \n- generics enable us to create components that work with any data type while still providing compile-time type safety.\n### Imports and Exports \n- TS follows the ES6 module system using import and export statements to share code between different files.\n\n### Typescript Advance APIs:\n#### Pick:\n- Allows us to create a new type by selecting a set of properties (keys) from an existing type (Type).\n- Image if we have an user model , with several properties, but for a user profile display, we only need a subset of these properties.\n#### Partial:\n- Makes all properties of a type optional, creating a type with the same properties but each marked as optional.\n#### readonly \n- when we have an configuration object  that should not be altered after initialization, making it `ReadOnly` ensures its properties cannot be changed.\n\n#### Record and Map\n- Record lets us give a cleaner type to objects.\n- Easier way to deal with objects.\n- maps gives an even fancier way\n\n#### Exclude\n- In a function that can accept several types of inputs , but we want to exclude specific types form being passed to it.\n- ",

    "content": "Building a research assistant agent from scratch is a rewarding project that moves beyond simple chatbots and into the realm of **autonomous workflows**. To do this right, you need to transition from \"sending a prompt\" to \"designing a loop.\"\n\nHere is a roadmap to building your agent, moving from architecture to implementation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Core Architecture\n\nAn agent isn't just a model; it’s a system. Your research assistant needs four specific components:\n\n- **The Brain (LLM):** Usually a high-reasoning model (like Gemini 1.5 Pro or GPT-4o) that can handle complex instructions and long contexts.\n    \n- **The Tools (Action Space):** These allow the agent to interact with the world (e.g., Google Search API, ArXiv scraper, PDF parser).\n    \n- **The Memory:** * _Short-term:_ The current conversation and intermediate research steps.\n    \n    - _Long-term:_ A vector database (like Pinecone or Chroma) to store and retrieve past research papers.\n        \n- **The Planning Loop:** This is the logic where the agent looks at a goal, decides which tool to use, executes it, observes the result, and repeats until the task is done.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 2. Choose Your Framework\n\nWhile you can code this in pure Python, using an agentic framework will save you weeks of work:\n\n- **LangGraph (Top Choice):** Built by the LangChain team, it allows you to create \"cyclic\" graphs. This is perfect for research because the agent often needs to go back and re-search if the first result wasn't good enough.\n    \n- **CrewAI:** Great if you want _multiple_ agents (e.g., one \"Researcher\" agent and one \"Technical Writer\" agent) working together.\n    \n- **Autogen:** Microsoft’s framework for conversational agents.\n    \n\n---\n\n## 3. Step-by-Step Build Guide\n\n### Phase A: Setup the Environment\n\nYou'll need an environment where your agent can browse the web.\n\n1. **Search API:** Sign up for **Tavily** or **Serper**. These are search engines optimized specifically for LLMs (returning clean markdown instead of messy HTML).\n    \n2. **PDF Processing:** Use **PyMuPDF** or **Unstructured.io** to help your agent \"read\" downloaded research papers.\n    \n\n### Phase B: Define the Tools\n\nIn your code, you must wrap functions so the LLM knows how to call them.\n\n> **Example:** You create a function `search_arxiv(query)`. You give the LLM a description: _\"Use this tool to find peer-reviewed papers on ArXiv.\"_\n\n### Phase C: The \"Reasoning\" Loop (ReAct)\n\nYou will likely implement the **ReAct (Reason + Act)** pattern. The prompt logic looks like this:\n\n1. **Thought:** \"The user wants to know about LLM quantization. I should first search for the latest papers from 2024.\"\n    \n2. **Action:** Call `web_search(\"LLM quantization methods 2024\")`.\n    \n3. **Observation:** \"I found three papers: AWQ, GGUF, and HQQ.\"\n    \n4. **Thought:** \"Now I need to summarize the specific benefits of HQQ.\"\n\nTo build a research assistant, you need to implement four things: **Tools**, **Reasoning**, **Execution**, and **Memory**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Logic: The \"ReAct\" Loop\n\nMost agents follow the **ReAct** (Reason + Act) pattern. Instead of the LLM giving a final answer immediately, you force it to follow a specific thought process:\n\n1. **Thought:** The LLM describes what it needs to find.\n    \n2. **Action:** The LLM names a tool to use (e.g., `web_search`).\n    \n3. **Observation:** You run that tool in Python and give the result back to the LLM.\n    \n4. **Final Answer:** Once it has enough info, it stops and answers.\n\n|**Feature**|**RAG**|**Agent**|\n|---|---|---|\n|**Primary Goal**|Knowledge (Facts)|Action (Tasks)|\n|**Logic Flow**|**Linear:** Question → Search → Answer.|**Iterative:** Question → Plan → Action → Observe → Repeat.|\n|**Autonomy**|Low (Follows a fixed pipeline).|High (Decides which tools to use and when).|\n|**Analogy**|A librarian finding the right book for you.|A researcher who goes to the library, takes notes, and writes a report.|\n|**Complexity**|Simpler to build and debug.|Harder to control; prone to \"infinite loops.\"|\n### The Modern Standard: \"Agentic RAG\"\n\nFor a high-quality research assistant, you combine them. You build an **Agent** that has a **RAG Tool** in its toolbox.\n\n> **Example Loop from Scratch:**\n> \n> 1. **Agent Thought:** \"I need to know about Bio-transformers. I'll search my local database first.\"\n>     \n> 2. **Agent Action:** `run_rag_tool(\"What are bio-transformers?\")`\n>     \n> 3. **Observation:** \"No results found in local database.\"\n>     \n> 4. **Agent Thought:** \"Okay, local search failed. I will now use my Web Search tool.\"\n>     \n> 5. **Agent Action:** `run_web_search(\"Bio-transformers research 2024\")`\n\n\nStarting with a pure **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system allows you to master the \"data\" side—indexing, embedding, and retrieval—without the chaos of an autonomous agent.\n\nOnce your RAG system is reliable, turning it into an **Agentic RAG** simply means giving an LLM the \"remote control\" to your RAG function.\n\n---\n\n## Phase 1: Building the \"Static\" RAG\n\nTo build this without a framework, you need to handle three specific steps: **Extraction**, **Embedding**, and **Retrieval**.\n\n### 1. The Extraction (PDF Parsing)\n\nResearch papers are often dual-column and full of citations. Using a basic library like `pypdf` is a good starting point for a \"scratch\" project.\n\n### 2. The Embedding (The \"Map\")\n\nYou need to turn text into numbers (vectors). You can use a local model (like `sentence-transformers`) or an API (like Gemini's embedding model).\n\n### 3. The Retrieval (The Search)\n\nWhen a user asks a question, you embed the question and find the \"closest\" vectors in your database using **Cosine Similarity**.\n\n## Phase 2: Moving to \"Agentic\" RAG\n\nIn a standard RAG, the flow is: **User Query → Search → Answer.** It only happens once.\n\nIn **Agentic RAG**, the LLM controls the loop. This adds three \"Superpowers\" to your research assistant:\n\n### A. Query Reformulation\n\nIf a user asks a vague question, the Agent rewrites it into a better search query before hitting the RAG database.\n\n- **User:** \"How do they fix the hallucination problem in that paper?\"\n    \n- **Agent Thought:** \"I should search for 'hallucination mitigation techniques' and 'Self-Correction logic' in the document.\"\n    \n\n### B. Multi-Hop Reasoning\n\nIf the answer requires connecting info from Page 2 and Page 20, a standard RAG might miss the connection. An agent can:\n\n1. Search for \"Methodology.\"\n    \n2. Read the observation.\n    \n3. Search for \"Results\" based on what it learned in the methodology.\n    \n\n### C. The \"I Don't Know\" Filter\n\nA standard RAG will often try to \"force\" an answer from the top 3 results, even if they aren't relevant. An Agent can look at the search results and say: _\"These snippets don't actually answer the question. I will try a different search term or tell the user I can't find it.\"_\n\n\nSince you already have the \"ReAct\" loop logic, you just wrap your Phase 1 RAG into a function and call it a **Tool**.\n\n\n## 1. Phase 1: Local Knowledge Ingestion\n\nYour first goal is to turn multiple PDFs into a searchable index.\n\n### Step A: The PDF Chunking\n\nYou can't feed a whole book into an LLM at once. You need to break it into \"chunks.\"\n\n- **The Strategy:** Overlapping chunks (e.g., 500 characters with a 100-character overlap) ensure that if a fact is split between two chunks, the context remains.\n### Step B: The \"Vector Store\" From Scratch\n\nInstead of using a database like Pinecone, you can store your embeddings in a simple Python list and use **Cosine Similarity** to find the best match.\n\n## 2. Phase 2: The Agentic Fallback Logic\n\nNow, we create the \"Brain.\" We tell the LLM to look at the local data first. If the data is empty or irrelevant, it must trigger a web search.\n\n### The System Prompt\n\nThis is where you define the \"Fixed Token Count\" and the \"Fallback\" behavior.\n\n### The \"Loop\" Execution\n\nThis logic connects your Local RAG to your Web Tool.\n\n## 3. The Web Search Tool (From Scratch)\n\nFor the web search, you can use the **Tavily API** (easiest for agents) or scrape a search engine directly. If you want to keep it \"scratch,\" you can use a simple wrapper around Google:\n\n\n## Summary of the Build Order\n\n1. **Ingestion:** Write the PDF parser and chunker.\n    \n2. **Embedding:** Create a loop that sends each chunk to an embedding API (like Gemini or OpenAI) and saves the vectors in a `.npy` file.\n    \n3. **Search:** Implement the `cosine_similarity` function to find the top 3 chunks for any query.\n    \n4. **Agent Logic:** Write the \"If/Else\" controller that checks for the `TRIGGER_WEB_SEARCH` string.\n    \n\n**Would you like me to dive deeper into the code for a specific part, like the exact math for the embeddings or the scraping logic for the web search?**\n\nRef: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUQJ9eeP-Ls",

Ver hard to do user specific access in them.\n\t\t- There are some databases (firebase) that lets us get rid of the http server and they try their best to provide granular access.\n- Databases usually allow access to 4 primitives:\n\t- Create data \n\t- Read data\n\t- Update data\n\t- Delete data \n\t- popularly called as CRUD \n- In mongoose, first we have to define the schema \n- Mongoose is schemaless, but mongoose makes us define schema for things like autocompletions and validating data before it goes in the DB to make sure that we are doing things right \n- Schemaless DBs can be very dangerous , using schemas in Mongo makes it slightly less dangerous.\n- In production , we use an ORM like Prisma.\n- Schema means the structure of the data that we are putting in there in the first place.\n- Eg: we want to define a course selling app , where we have two entities - user schema and course schema \n```js \nconst UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n\temail: String,\n\tpassword: String,\n\tpurchasedCourses: [{\n\t\ttype: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,\n\t\tref: 'Course'\n\t}]\n});\n\nconst CourseSchema = new mongoose.Schema({\n\ttitle: String,\n\tprice: 5999\n});\n\n// and then we can use them as \nconst User = mongoose.model('User',UserSchema);\nconst Course = mongoose.model('Course',CourseSchema);\n```\n\n-  SQL databases dont let us put nested , transitivite objects - we would have to do joins on the table to get the data.\n\t- Mongodb lets us do it.\n- The way to do relationships in Mongodb , is to create an array of things to be done.\n\t- These strings are what creates a table in the Mongodb Compass.\n#### CRUD Operations on MongoDB:\n- Insert data into the database using mongoose:\n- ```js \n\t  User.create({\n\t\t  username: req.body.username,\n\t\t  password: req.body.password\n\t  });\n```\n- Find users by Id\n```js \n\t  User.findById(\"1\");\n\t  User.findOne({\n\t\t  username: \"sagnikc@gmail.com\"\n\t  });\n\t  //find any \n\t  User.find({\n\t  username: \"sagnikc@gmail.com\"\n\t  });\n```\n- Update one , using the given id\n```js \n\t  User.updateOne({\n\t  \"id\": \"1\"},\n\t  {$push: {purchasedCourses: courseId}});\n```\n\n- To add a new entry to the database, `$push` is the syntax to do it with the given course id.\n- Delete \n```js \nUser.deleteMany({});\n\nUser.deleteOne({\n\tusername:\"sagnikc@gmail.com\"\n});\n```\n\n\n#### Jargons to know in DB:\n- Cluster\n\t- A bought a machine, where we can write multiple databases.\n- Database\n\t- A collections of seperate table where things are actually kept.\n- Table \n\t- Where the data is actually stored.",

relationships within large datasets.\n\t- Training is simple, iterative loop of guessing and correcting:\n\t\t- start with a guess -> random values \n\t\t- measure error -> how far is the guess from the truth ?\n\t\t- adjust -> modify the guess to be slightly less wrong \n\t\t- repeat -> do this millions of time, until error zeros or very very close to zero.\n\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-24 at

mathematical function, not a biological mystery.\n\t- It takes some numbers in, performs basic arithmetic ,and outputs a signal.\n\t\t- Inputs -> numerical data points representing features (eg: house size, pixel intensity)\n\t\t- weights and summation -> importance assigned to each input, combined into a single weighted sum.\n\t\t- activation -> a non-linear function that decides whether the signal should be \"fired\" or not \"fired\".\n\t\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-24 at 10.24.49 AM.png](/images/posts/ai-ml-bootcamp-neural-networks-from-scratch-Screenshot-2026-01-24-at-10.24.49-AM.png)\n\t\t- Weights -> `W1,W2,W3....` , something that the change the weight accordingly to change the loss \n\t\t- Inputs -> Features \n\t\t- non-linearity -> activation function \n\t- Anatomy of a neuron :\n\t\t- `output = activation(\\sigma wixi + b)`\n\t\t- weights -> w -> determine the strength and importance of each input signal\n\t\t- bias (b) -> an offset that allows the neuron to shift its decision boundary \n\t\t- activation -> a nonlinear function that decides if the signal should \"fire\".\n\t- the need for activation functions :\n\t\t- Consider \n\t\t\t- Layer 1 -> `y := W1x + b1`\n\t\t\t- Layer 2 -> `z = W2y + b2`\n\t\t- Combining them we get \n\t\t\t- `Z = W2(W1x+b1) + b2`\n\t\t\t- `Z = (W2W1)X + (W2b1+b2)`\n\t\t- this will then simplify to:\n\t\t\t- `z = W'x + b'` \n\t\t\t- where \n\t\t\t\t- `W' = W2W1`\n\t\t\t\t- `b' = W2b1+b2`\n\t\t- so basically if we are stacking layers cause it will just results in another linear function.\n\t\t- so 100 layers of this thing will be equivalent to just one.\n\t\t- so if we add non-linearity to this , we can solve this function.\n\t- How Activation Function solves this :\n\t\t- activation functions add \"bends\" to the math, preventing layers from collapsing into each other -> **breaking the linearity** and linear combination of operations.\n\t\t- **Enabling Depth** -> \"secret sauce\" that allows deep networks to learn complex, multi-layered representations.\n\t\t- **Universal Approximation** -> Non-linearity allows the networks to model any continuous functions, no matter how complex the function is.\n\t- Different Activations Functions \n\t\t- sigmoid \n\t\t\t- classic S-curve 0-1.\n\t\t\t- default used for probabilistic ML.\n\t\t- tanh \n\t\t\t- zero centered (-1 to 1)\n\t\t\t- often provides faster convergence than sigmoid.\n\t\t- ReLU\n\t\t\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-24 at 10.55.52

\n\t\t\t- GELU -> modern smooth version of ReLU.\n\t\t\t- Swish \n- **Loss Functions**:\n\t- The thing where the feedback loop starts.\n\t- I.e minimizing this score the ML systems get better \n\t- loss = a single number measuring how wrong we are \n\t- lower loss implies better predictions \n\t- training goal of a ml system is to minimize the loss.\n\t- most of the times we used mean squared error (MSE) to compute loss\n\t\t- `L = (1/n) \\sigma (predicition -target)^2`\n\t\t- Squares will make all the errors positive \n\t\t- big errors will be penalized more than small errors \n\t\t- good for regression tasks.\n- Backpropogation:\n\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-24 at 11.06.04 AM.png](/images/posts/ai-ml-bootcamp-neural-networks-from-scratch-Screenshot-2026-01-24-at-11.06.04-AM.png)\n\t- how does the machine knows which weights to adjust to minimize loss ?\n\t- it checks which nodes weights that we need to change.\n\t- Intuition for backprop:\n\t\t- in a big org, something went wrong, and why are things are down ?\n\t\t\t- ceo would ask vp , vp to managers and the managers to employees\n\t\t\t- they are backpropogating to find the error and to trying to optimize the process\n\t\t- basically like a chain of responsibility.\n\t\t- error signal travel backwards from the output later through the hidden layers to the input.\n\t\t- adjustment: each weight is adjusted proportionally to its contribution to the final mistake.\n- **Learning Rate**:\n\t- a hyperparameter -> something that is tunable and can be changed.\n\t- how fast or how slow we can tune the loss minimization\n\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-24 at 11.15.52 AM.png](/images/posts/ai-ml-bootcamp-neural-networks-from-scratch-Screenshot-2026-01-24-at-11.15.52-AM.png)\n\t- (loss with a 2d graph and 3d repr)\n\t- loss landscape -> visualize how the loss looks for our loss function\n\t- we try to move in the direction of the greatest gradient \n\t- learning rate telling us how fast to go there \n\t\t- high learning rate might take us directly or it might overshoot\n\t\t- slow learning rate might take a lot of time to get to the optimum\n- **Gradient Descent**:\n\t- Strategy:\n\t\t- Step Downhill : Feel the slope and take a step in that direction that reduces the loss.\n\t\t- Iterative Progress : repeat the process, taking step after step until we reach the bottom\n\t\t- Goal : Reach the global minimum - the point where the model's error is the minimum.\n- Whole Training Loop:\n\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-24 at 11.31.22

This is how the machines represent concepts as data.\n\t\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-23 at 10.55.13 AM.png](/images/posts/ai-ml-bootcamp-catching-upto-transformers-Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-10.55.13-AM.png)\n\t\t- Words as Positions in Space\n\t\t\t- If a word is a list of numbers, its a point on a map.

Proximity indicates shared meaning.\n#### magic of embeddings\n- word math \n\t- king - man + woman  = queen \n\t- paris - france + italy = rome \n\t- walking  - walk + swim = swimming \n- can embeddings solve our earlier problems ?\n\t- in basic word embeddings, each word has exactly ONE position in space.\n\t- \"I went to the bank to deposit cash\"\n\t- \"I sat on the bank of the river\"\n#### Sequence Models (RNNs)\n- okay we can make embeddings now, but what to make of that embedding exactly.\n- we are not able to make use of the embedding and use it anyhow.\n- Idea: Process the sentence one word at a time, building up understanding as we go.\n\t- Model maintains a \"memory\" of what it has read so far.\n- Eg: other models like GRUS, LSTMS etc. and other divergent fields like Mambas \n- Even in fact , Transformers are the best version of top of the sequence models.\n- Its a architecture , that deals with the sequence and from each word they retain some memory.\n- the context and upcoming word , change the meaning of our word completely.\n- Problem : Forgetting \n\t- World ,storage and memroy is finite.\n\t- And it has to go back a long vectors back.\n\t- meaning would completey disrupt as it goes back a lot of tokens.\n- RNNs struggle with long sentences because they process information linearly and have limited memory capacity.\n\t- LSTM came up after RNN, added gates for choice to add to its memory and the memory and the information that it needs to retain is very less.\n\t- GRUS came after that \n### Transformers\n- stage is set around 2017\n- what we have till now\n\t- word embeddings\n\t- sequence models(RNNs)\n\t- Tons of internet data \n\t- Powerful GPUs\n- We are just lacking in a powerful way to make all these work better.\n-  (old idea) process words one by one, like reading a book from start to end.\n-  The idea of transformer \n\t- Simultaneous\n\t\t- Look at every word in the sentence at the same time.\n\t- Attention\n\t\t- model \"attends\" to the most relevant words, no matter how far apart they are.\n- Have to make them more selective and it was wasting more of their information.\n- And the second thing that we need to do is , all the word that we are processing should be done parallely.\n\t- Attention enables the model to focus only on the most relevant word.\n#### Attention in Action\n- when the model looks at the focus word, the attention mechanism tells it to pay the most attention to it.\n- ![Screenshot 2026-01-23 at 12.58.46 PM.png](/images/posts/ai-ml-bootcamp-catching-upto-transformers-Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-12.58.46-PM.png)\n- how it happens depends on the maths behind it \n- Model \"knows\" what the pronouns refers to buiding a context aware representation of every word is.\n- Why Attention is powerful :\n\t- More memory -> every word in a sentence \"sees\" every other word simultaneously , no matter how far apart they are \n\t- Parallel Processing -> Unlike RNNs that read word by word, Transformers process all words at once, making training incredibly fast.\n\t- Deep Understanding -> The model builds a mathematical map of how every word relates to every other word in the specific context.\n- ![Screenshot 2026-01-23 at 7.38.54 PM.png](/images/posts/ai-ml-bootcamp-catching-upto-transformers-Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-7.38.54-PM.png)\n- By changing just one word (tired vs wide), the model's attention shifts, correctly identifying what \"it\" refers to in each context.\n- Whole Flow (of a transformer based language model):\n\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-23 at 7.49.03 PM.png](/images/posts/ai-ml-bootcamp-catching-upto-transformers-Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-7.49.03-PM.png)\n\t- takes the sentence , outputs a list of words and adds to the sentence and basically repeats itself until the MAX_TOKEN_LENGTH that its allowed.\n- Why \"Predict the Next Word\" Creates Understanding \n\t- Grammar and Syntax\n\t\t- Predicting the next word requires the model to internalize language structure and rules.\n\t- Factual Knowledge \n\t\t- Correct predictions rely on learned factual relations between concepts.\n\t- Logic and Understanding\n\t\t- Following a chain of reasoning lets the model anticipate the appropriate continuation.\n- Generation of Text\n\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-23 at 8.04.31 PM.png](/images/posts/ai-ml-bootcamp-catching-upto-transformers-Screenshot-2026-01-23-at-8.04.31-PM.png)\n\t- Generation is a iterative loop.\n\t- Each predicted word is added back to the input and the model predicts the next word based on the updated context.\n\n### Foundation Models\n- \"Foundation\" models are pre-trained models based on huge corpus of data and training loop.\n- It's kind of like the base knowledge. \n- We no longer build tools from scratch, we build on top of these giants.\n- General Purpose AI\n\n\n### Current Directions (2024-25)\n- Multimodality \n\t- AI is no longer just text. It can see images, hear voices, and speak back in real time.\n- Reasoning \n\t- How models are designed to \"think\" before they speak, solving complex math and logic problems.\n- Agents \n\t- shift from chatbot to agents that can use tools, browse the we, and complete multi-step tasks \n\t- different applications that we see on the internet that use some source of LLM \n\t\t- take input from user, use some LLM and building on top of that.\n\t",

    "content": "### before react \n- why was react written a certain way\n- generating the foundations for react \n- makes the process easier to learn harder concepts down the line \n- internet has static and dynamic websites\n\t- more things get appended to the bottom \n\t- the html that we got back from the server initially is slowly getting appended \n\t- through DOM manipulation are people able to create websites -> before React \n\t- as they scroll and add more posts , append new posts, DOM manipulation , updating things on the DOM ,without us hard refreshing the page\n\t- all of this HTML being injected in the DOM via javascript\n\t- update the DOM when we clicked on the button\n- DOM manipulation is very hard to write as a developer, Making dynamic websites, with the primitives that DOM provides us is very hard.\n\t- thats why react came into the picture.\n\t- `document.createElement`\n\t- `document.appendChild`\n\t- `document.setAttribute`\n\t- `element.children`\n- adding title, description , followed by a button and we add a method addTodo to do onclick handler.\n- ugly approach on updating :\n\t- add the whole HTML in the innerHTML tag and fit in that \n\t```js \n\tdocument.getElementElementById('container').innerHTML = `\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div>${title}</div>\n\t\t<div>${description}</div>\n\t\t<button>Mark as Done</button>\n\t</div>`;\n\t```\n\t- appendChild -> add this item as a child on the DOM Tree\n- instead of manually updating it by setting `innerHTML`, its better to set the items using by first setting an outerDiv and then adding elements to it.\n- the goals is to create something in memory and then eventually put them in DOM.\n- `setAttribute` lets us sets attributes on a specific tag.\n- Problem with this approach till now:\n\t- very hard to add and remove elements , no central state !\n\t- what if there is a server where these todos are put\n\t- what if we update a TODO from a mobile app, and get a new array of todos on the frontend, how will we update the DOM then ?\n\t- We only have a `addTodo` function , we dont have a `updateTodo` or `removeTodo` function yet !\n- If we can write a function that takes state as an input and creates the output on right, much more powerful than our original approach.\n- DOM Manipulation is the only way to create dynamic websites\n\t- making it very hard for even writing a simple website \n\t- even react under the hood interacts with DOM to make websites.\n- the next objective is to given a state , we can render the state on the DOM.\n- what we want ideally is to build a diff and only apply the diff to the DOM instead of clearing the screen and building it again.\n\t- dont clear the DOM upfront, update it based on what has changed.\n\t- Question is, how does it calculate what all has changed ?\n\t- Has a TODO been marked as complete ?\n\t- Has a TODO been removed from the backend ?\n\t- Hint: Remembering / keeping track of the old todos in a variable (virtual DOM)\n- In the real world, given a set of dynamic TODOs, we would have to render and re-render the latest data and update the DOM accordingly.\n\t- given a state whatever we want on the screen , we need to update the DOM accordingly.\n\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-26 at 8.03.17 PM.png](/images/posts/100xdevs-react-Screenshot-2026-01-26-at-8.03.17-PM.png)\n- Better way to update the DOM(according to what React does):\n\t- Dont clear the DOM upfront, update it based on what has changed.\n\t- Question is, how does it calculate what all has changed ?\n\t\t- Has a todo been marked as complete ?\n\t\t- Has a todo been removed from the backend ?\n\t- You calculate the difference \n\t\t- based on the diff, calculate the diff and its a slightly better way of solving the same problem.\n\t- We remember the old todos in a variable -> Virtual DOM \n\t\t- Place where they have a storage of the DOM.\n\n### react\n- what is the easiest way to create a dynamic frontend website ?\n\t- update a state variable\n\t\t- general developer logic \n\t- delegate the task of figuring out the diff to a hefty function \n\t\t- react core library \n\t- tell the hefty function how to add, update and remove elements.\n\t\t- react dom \n\t\t- react native \n- react takes care of re-rendering the whole thing and figuring out what to print and what to update.\n\t- our code is pretty lean and we dont have to update the changes here.\n- react dom , react native etc. exposes the functionalities to react, whereas react is a diff calculating framework that calculates the things to be put on the DOM.\n- virtual dom and real dom the changes are not propogated immediately \n\t- react does a bunch of optimizations and does a bunch call\n\t- batching the changes helps in performance \n\n### diving deep into react:\n- jargon to learn \n\t- jsx \n\t- class vs classname\n\t- static vs dynamic websites \n\t- state \n\t- components \n\t- re-rendering \n- why do we need react ?\n\t- for static websites, you don't\n\t- dont need for dynamic websites - can do in HTML,CSS and JS.\n\t- the contents of the page are changing , when we are changing the press buttons.\n\t- For dynamic websites, these libraries makes us life easier to do DOM Manipulation.\n- react is just an easier way to write normal HTML/CSS/JS.\n- Its a new syntax, that under the hood gets converted to HTML/CSS/JS.\n- People realized that its harder to do DOM manipulation the conventional way.\n- new syntax to write frontends.\n\n- how react makes this better at writing frontends?\n\t- For creating react app, we only need to usually worry about 2 things \n\t\t- State \n\t\t\t- An object that represents the current state of the application.\n\t\t\t- It represents the dynamic things in our app (things that change)\n\t\t\t- Eg: the value of the counter b\n\t\t- Components \n\t\t\t- things that can be reused in our application and used throughout \n\t\t\t- how a DOM element should render, given a state.\n\t\t\t- Eg: counter button itself\t\t\n\t\t\t- Eg: Button is a component that takes the state(currentCount) as an input and is supposed to render it accordingly.\n- We usually have to define all of our components once , and then all we have to do is to update the state of our application, React will take care of re-rendering the application.\n- ![Screenshot 2026-01-27 at 6.52.32 PM.png](/images/posts/100xdevs-react-Screenshot-2026-01-27-at-6.52.32-PM.png)\n- a state change renders a re-render.\n\t- effectively the function takes a global state and does a re-render of the thing.\n\t- the function takes a state as an input and spits a state as an output.\n\n### todo app:\n- in useState is the initial state value.\n- count and setCount are the two state variables that store the value for the same.\n- `App()` is our first component.\n- npm run build will generate a static build of all the code \n\t- similar to the JS browser / target based code it will generate \n\t- we can directly serve it .\n- when we want to render a JS variable in JSX we have to wrap it in `{}` braces. \n- in onClickHandler dont have to call the function , just give the function name and react under the hood knows that we need to call this function.\n- react will automatically know when to update the state and given an state it will reconcile into a state it gets the value updated.\n-  we give it state and component, and any time the state updates, the component should re-render.\n\t- because react does not look at every variable as a state variable.\n\t- if we have to define a state variable then we have to do it a certain way.\n\t- using useState() hook to define our state, and if we define the state , we can update it.\n- `const [count,setCount] = useState(0);`\n\t- the first value put it in count and the second value put it in setCount.\n\t- setCount when called , it calls another function that dispatches and re-renders the thing here.\n- the right way to use state variables, is that it gave a state variable and with that given value is to call the value.\n\t- so any time onClickHandler is called , we have to set the state and react re-renders the thing similar to the thing on button press.\n- we pass inputs to an custom component is through something called `props`.\n\t- can create multiple children components and the parent components call pass the values and render it there.\n\t- can access them using props.obj_name and props.user_name\n\t- can reuse the component again and again \n- high-level we have defined our own application and reused it.\n- `setTodos([...todos,{...` spreads out all the todos and sets all the values from the array here \n\t- we want all the original todos and this new todo at the end.\n\t- can add more items to the state and react takes care of handling of how to add the items to the todos.\n- while iterating over the list of objects, react to render would require a key property so that it is unique.\n- Any time a parent re-renders , its child re-renders as well.\n- to put any css , we put it as an object with 2 curly braces.\n```js \n<button style={{}}></button>\n```\n- todos is a state which is being passed as a component.\n\t- we can pass todos which is a state variable , compared to the new component.\n- vite is one of many ways to bootstrap and bundler to build a react app, others also exist.\n\t- many such frameworks , to bootstrap our application, watching files, bundling files etc.\n\n### React Deeper Dive :\n#### React returns \n- reach component can return a single top-level xml\n- Why?\n\t- makes it easier to do reconciliation \n\t- jsx expressions should have one parent div \n\t- cannot return an xml that doesnt have a top level parent div \n\t- can instead of extra div , we can also add a empty fragment or a React.Fragment.\n- react -> dynamic website \n\t- the content changes very quickly \n\t- react is the easy way to create this\n\t- create, update and upload anything on the dom is a good way to re-render \n\t- whenever the dom updates happen, is called a re-render.\n\t- in react, we want to minimize the re-renders \n- need to add optimizations to reduce the number of re-renders to make it performant.\n#### re-rendering \n- a re-render means that \n\t- react did some work to calculate what all should update in this component.\n\t- the component actually gets called (we can put a logger to confirm this)\n\t- the inspector shows us a bounding box around the component\n- it happens when\n\t- a state variable that is being used inside a component changes\n\t- a parent component re-renders triggers all children re-rendering \n- 2 ways of keeping the re-rendering less:\n\t- pushing the state down \n\t- react.memo knows the title has not changed, so we dont need to change it.\n- wrapping a component inside react.memo will make it only change it when it has a dynamic state change , not only when there are static changes.\n- react has a exact copy of the DOM somewhere else and many times we change the state variable - it creates a new diff ,and based on the diff it decides what it needs to do - like create, update or delete element.\n- always push state from parent to child.\n#### key \n- each child in a list should have a unique prop.\n- thats the way the diffing engine will keep track of changes that have formed.\n- key tells react to make the correct updates to the dom and keep track of the changes.\n#### wrapper components \n- you can create an meta component, that takes the inner component as an onput.\n- not necessary that the component always has to take state as an input.\n- whenever we make a component, inside which we pass children, inside that we get access to the whole thing in the children component, inside the variable.\n- the structure of the outer thing and inside this what others can write inside this\n- using that we can reach the final state of what inside can be written inside it.\n### hooks:\n- until now we have discussed useState.\n- these functions that start with use are called as hooks.\n- hooks in react are functions that allow us to hook into react state and lifecycle features from function components.\n- other examples of hooks:\n\t- useEffect\n\t- useMemo\n\t- useCallback \n\t- useRef\n\t- useReducer \n\t- useContext \n\t- useLayoutEffect \n- lifecycle features:\n\t- earlier react used to be written in a different way.\n\t\t- we got access to lifecycle functions \n\t- before functional components, we had class based components \n\t- `onComponentMount` and `onComponentUnmount` would be two methods associated with it and it will be used to hook onto it.\n\t- bunch of the lifecycle functions , it re-renders\n\t- used to be the way in class based components\n- harder to do it functional components, so hooks were introduced.\n- some jargon:\n\t- side effects \n\t\t- the operations can affect other components, interact with browser or do asynchronous changes.\n\t\t- in react, we have functional components and anything not related to rendering , etc. are considered part of side effects as they are not part of the main react rendering cycle.\n\t\t- eg: fetching data from the backend \n\t\t- this asynchronous call can be called as a side effect to the codebase \n\t\t- these need to be seperate from our rendering cycle.\n\t\t- eg: setTimeout , fetch, setInterval\n\t\t- shouldnt necessarily collude with the rendering cycle\n\t- hooks \n\t\t- went part of react for the longest time \n\t\t- allows us to use many state management techniques without explicitly calling lifecycle events.\n\t\t- they enable functional components to have access to stateful logic and lifecycle features, which were previously only possible in class components.\n\t\t- This has lead to a more concise and readable way of writing components in React.\n##### useState\n- lets us describe the state of our application \n- whenever state updates, it will trigger a re-render which will finally result in a DOM update.\n- the problem comes when we have to do some other side effect or hit a backend api etc. which we can't do with the useState.\n##### useEffect \n- allows us to do lifecycle event \n- allows us to do things when component is mounted \n- when the component gets put into the dom , is called a mount \n- some things should run when this element is being put there \n- that is the use of the `onComponentMount`\n- similarly we would have an action when the things need to be unmounted.\n- useEffect lets us hook onto it.\n- we are only sending one request when the component mounts \n```js \nconst [todos,setTodos] = useState([]);\n\nuseEffect(() => {\nfetch(url).then(async (res) => {\nconst json = await res.json();\nsetTodos[json]})},[]);\n```\n- for making async useEffect , use the library useAsyncEffect or capsulate it inside another async function.\n- useEffect hook serves the same purpose as `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` and `componentWillUnmount` in react class components, but unified into a single API.\n- when the thing renders for the first time, the code will run and never will it run again , only the first time the component is mounted\n\t- thats why a popular hook to do some actions under some conditions.\n- the dependency array at the end, tells when should the callback fn has to be run.\n\t- it takes state variables as input and any time the state variable changes , it will run the callback fn.\n\t- want to run a certain logic when the state variable changes.\n- axios is very big and only getting get function.\n\t- using tree shaking , the final library would only get that library in the final build.\n- arrow functions vs normal functions \n\t- only matters  when require to use  bind and this in functions \n- \n##### useMemo\n- memo means remembering some output given an input and not computing it again.\n\t- like caching.\n\t- have this cached value, dont recompute the result again.\n- eg: lets say you are a f1 driver and want to check how much petrol is left. Would u do that in every lap ? Would you do that every 10 laps ? or every 20 mins ?\n- eg2: create an app that does 2 things:\n\t- increase a counter by 1\n\t- lets user put a value in an input box (n) and we need to show sum from 1-n \n\t- restriction: everything needs to inside App\n- when we click on the button, it re-runs the expensive operation again of summing value and cant we just remember the value from the last and keep the sum intact.\n\t- across values if you want to remember the values in state variable, we would use useMemo.\n\t- an ugly way to do this would be via useEffect , where any time a loop is running we would take the value and store the result somewhere \n\t- the problem is to use a unneccesaray re-render \n\t```js \n\tconst [counter,setCounter] = useState(0);\n\tconst [inputValue,setInputValue] = useState(1);\n\tconst [finalValue,setFinalValue] = useState(0);\n\t\n\tuseEffect(() => {\n\tlet count = 0;\n\tfor(let i=1;i<= inputValue;i++){\n\tcount += 1;\n\t}\n\t},inputValue);\n\t\n\treturn <div>\n\t<input onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)} placeholder={\"Find the sum from 1 to n\"}>\n\t<br />\n\tSum from 1 to {inputValue} is {finalValue}\n\t<br />\n\t<button onClick={() => setCounter(counter+1)>Counter ({counter}) </button>\n\t</div>\n\t```\n- we are updating the state variable , which will cause 2 re-renders.\n- a better approach would be to run all the counter logic only when some value changes and not we recomputing the same thing again and again.\n##### useCallback \n- memo lets us skip re-rendering a component when its props are unchanged.\n\t- if we wrap the child inside a memo, it will only re-render if the inputs to the child have changed.\n- basically if you ever want to memoize a function, we use useCallback.\n- useCallback is about not rendering a child, if the function doesnt need to change across renders.\n##### useRef \n- you want to overwrite what the state library has written over the screen\n\n##### useContext\n- ref from react.dev\n#### custom hooks\n- hooks that we can create on our own and use it \n- can create custom hooks for others to use\n- must start with `use` primitive \n\t- can contain other hooks inside it \n- the thing inside a hook must be another hook or a component.\n\n### prop drilling:\n- how do you think one should manage state ?\n\t- keep everything in the top level component or \n\t- keep everything as low as possible (at the Least Common Ancestor of children that need a state)\n- the idea is to keep things at the low level component \n- should try to push down state as much as possible.\n\t- so that other states dont need to re-render as much as possible.\n- store at the least common ancestor.\n- push it down as much as possible.\n- we are drilling down the props.\n- if there are components \n\t- ![Screenshot 2026-02-15 at 8.20.34 AM.png](/images/posts/100xdevs-react-Screenshot-2026-02-15-at-8.20.34-AM.png)\n\t- if c1 has props, c2,c3 doesnt, they still need to pass it down the props , so that c4 can get it.\n- if there is a state variable, that needs to be used,it should be in their lowest ancestor, we are just passing it down.\n\t- this is what is called as prop drilling .\n\t- anti-pattern because how unmanageable it makes the code.\n\t- it is unappealing because how visually unappealing it makes the code look like at.\n- Prop drilling doesnt mean that the parent re-renders children, it just means the syntactic uneasiness when writing code.\n\n### routing in react:\n- react-router-dom\n- two simple ways to directly switch \n\t- `window.locaton.href=path-name`\n\t- global location object we have access to in the DOM\n\t- but this we refetch the page everytime \n- better to use `useNavigate()` hook so as to not take hard render of it.\n\t- need to use inside a component \n- lazy loading \n\t- rn , a complete bundle comes back all at once \n\t\t- the problem is , the person will just come to landing page , all the bundle will come back all at once , which is not required, if the person is just in the dashboard.\n\t\t- the person should only receive the code for the given bundle the require - only give them a small bundle\n\t\t- incremently giving them the website than giving the whole web page \n\t- react-router allows us to to do lazy loading and incrementally allows us to give the pages as required.\n\t- they will lazily load the more page components , on the page they are not currently on.\n\t- navigate wont fetch the data from backend , we do a fetch call from inside the component that we want to hit the backend APIs.\n\t- Suspense API\n\t\t- async data fetching wrapper \n\t\t- for async components and not have access to them immediately , we wrap it under a suspense API - depends on internet connection\n\t\t- for cases like this, react provides the suspense API.\n\t\t- wrapper the component to be rendered inside suspense, makes it that we have a mildly more client side optimized application.\n\t- the only thing here is we have to wrap this under a suspense. \n### Context API\n- lets us fix prop drilling \n- it makes us very easy to pass state components, without drilling it down.\n- \"teleport\" data to the components in the tree that need it without passing it down the prop chain.\n- if we are using the context api, we are pushing our state management outside the core react components.\n- `reducer/useReducer()` hook \n\t- basics of state management in react without using a library \n",

    "content": "### middlewares\n- what is the best place to do these prechecks ?\n- eg: authentication and input validation \n- do we need to write custom logic each time to check ? hint: for some things yes!\n- this is the job of middlewares - to do things that is either business logic or something that is not part of the main routing and request logic that can't be handled by express.\n- the dumb way of input validation is to take everything in query parameters or headers, and do it in the routing logic itself without seperating into business logic.\n```js\n//a scratch middleware\napp.get(\"/health-checkup\", (req, res) => {\n//auth for now\n\nconst userName = req.headers.userName;\n\nconst passwd = req.headers.passwd;\n\nconst kidneyId = req.query.kidneyId;\n\n  \n\nif (!userName === \"sagnik\" && passwd === \"pass\") {\n\nres.status(403).json({\n\nmsg: \" something wrong with inputs\",\n\n});\n\nreturn;\n\n}\n\nif (kidneyId != 1 || kidneyId != 2) {\n\nres.status(403).json({\n\nmsg: \"something wrong with inputs\",\n\n});\n\nreturn;\n\n}\nres.status(200).json({\nmsg: \"input validataion done!\",\n});\n//a scratch middleware\napp.get(\"/health-checkup\", (req, res) => {\n  //auth for now\n  const userName = req.headers.userName;\n  const passwd = req.headers.passwd;\n  const kidneyId = req.query.kidneyId;\n\n  if (!userName === \"sagnik\" && passwd === \"pass\") {\n    res.status(403).json({\n      msg: \" something wrong with inputs\",\n    });\n    return;\n  }\n  if (kidneyId != 1 || kidneyId != 2) {\n    res.status(403).json({\n      msg: \"something wrong with inputs\",\n    });\n    return;\n  }\n\n  res.status(200).json({\n    msg: \"input validataion done!\",\n  });\n});\n});\n```\n- what if we tell you to introduce another route that does kidney replacement ? inputs need to be the same \n\t- it would be a post route \n\t- we would again need to do input validation there again \n\t- violates the DRY principle \n\t- best if we abstract that logic elsewhere and check it there itself.\n- the real optimum to do all these things is to do prechecks using middlewares \n\t- middlewares is just another function that is specialized for that.\n\t- we can also then pick and choose various different middlewares for different things \n- How does middlewares pass that information to the other middleware  and how does it interact with other middleware ?\n\t- In the express http functions, instead of one callback functions, we can in fact give a range of callback functions.\n\t- there are 3 inputs to the callbacks, res,req,next \n\t\t- next we can call , if we think the things are fine\n\t\t- req, res used for pre-checks \n\t\t- if things are fine , then we chain it back to next \n\t\t- under the hood, express handles this \n\t- there can be multiple functions , instead of just one handler.\n- `app.use()` \n\t- only then can we catch any body that the response sends in the POST body handler.\n\t- this middleware is going to be called everywhere.\n\t- instead of passing it explictly, anything that comes after the `app.use()` line will have th middleware inside it.\n\n### input-validation\n- need some checks on the data that we are sending.\n- a very basic way is to catch the fields that we are passing in the request parameters and we check on that.\n- cause backends are open and people can send request with any type of inputs / wrong inputs.\n- as a application developer, its our duty to do sanity checks and do input validation so that server doesnt crash.\n- another type of middleware in js \n\t- Problem: someone else can read your exception eg: end-client can read the exception.\n\t- end user should see a clean repr of what happened.\n\t- express handles this under the hood\n\t- but better way to do is to use a global catches.\n\t- so we put `app.use(express.json())` before all the code \n\t- so any exception that is being caused, is handled in the global catches.\n\t- error handling middlewares:\n\t\t- Special type of middleware function in Express that has 4 arguments instead of three `(rerr,req,res,next)` \n\t\t- Express will recognize this as an error handling middleware because of these 4 arguments.\n- zod library:\n\t- to do input validation.\n\t- better way to do validation \n\t- prebuilt template and logic to check how to do input validation.\n\t- In Zod , what we are doing basically is parsing the input and checking on that\n\t\t- We define the schema on what the data should be like and zod will parse based on that.\n\t- zod gives us everything and gives us a bunch of error messages\n\t\t- super useful if you wanna show that in the UI.\n\t\t- some methods are present that we need to use it and use `safeParse` and the success object to check if validation passed or not.\n### authentication and JWT \n- anyone can send requests to your backend \n- how to ensure that this user has access to a certain resource ?\n- dumb way - ask user to send username and password\n- Better way-\n\t- give the user back a token on signup / login\n\t- ask the user to send back the token in all future requests \n\t- when the user logs out, ask the user to forget the token (or revoke it from the backend)\n- ![Screenshot 2026-01-21 at 6.23.32 PM.png](/images/posts/100xdevs-backend-basics-2-Screenshot-2026-01-21-at-6.23.32-PM.png)\n- Either an authorization header and this token is how we do signin / signup in websites.\n- User will creating this request and this is how we do authorization for it.\n- Project :\n\t- let people sign up to your website \n\t- only allowed signed in users to see people( create a dummy people list)\n\t- only allowed the signin users can access the content.\n- before we learn authentication, some cryptography jargon:\n\t- hashing \n\t\t- before we save the passwords to the db , we hash it, so that only users can access that.\n\t\t- and the hashed password will be stored in database \n\t\t- hashing -> converting a simple string to complicated gibberish, so that its only one way ; can never guess -> can never decrypt back to password.\n\t\t- how does the backend server validate this ?\n\t\t\t- backend server reconverts back to the string and compares it.\n\t\t\t- first inmemory we convert it back to the string and check if it is the same thing \n\t\t\t- one way (convert a string to hash )\n\t- Encryption \n\t\t- this is 2 way \n\t\t- can always convert the hashed result to the original string , provided we have some key.\n\t\t- hashing doesnt really require a password, encryption requires a password.\n\t\t- a string is encrypted using a password \n\t\t- string can also be decrypted using the same password.\n\t- JSON web tokens \n\t\t- some hashing function, but only works for JSON input \n\t\t- gives more structured data -> more longer string \n\t\t- in the end if we look at it, it is significantly different from hashing and encryption.\n\t\t- takes JSON as a input \n\t\t- Token:\n\t\t\t- it takes this and creates a token in the end \n\t\t\t- JWT \n\t\t\t- by default whoever has this input , can convert it back to the original object that we see.\n\t\t\t- anyone who has the string , can look at the original string that was formatted.\n\t\t\t- conversion anyone can do , but verification of this string can only be done by authorized backend servers that has created it.\n\t\t\t\t- given the string and the password, can pass it through a verification function and only return the original data , if the original thing was used to verify that.\n\t\t\t- `jwt.verify(<passwd>)` and can verified, only then we can authenticate the user.\n\t\t\t- very similar to encryption and decryption.\n\t\t\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-21 at 8.13.01 PM.png](/images/posts/100xdevs-backend-basics-2-Screenshot-2026-01-21-at-8.13.01-PM.png)\n\t\t\t- `jwt.verify()` will only allow if the user if true, otherwise not.\n\t\t- its neither of encryption or hashing (its technically a digital signature)\n\t\t- anyone can see the original output given the signature \n\t\t- signature can be verified only using the password.\n\t- Local Storage \n\t\t- a place in your browser where we can store some data \n\t\t- usually things that are stored include:\n\t\t\t- authentication tokens \n\t\t\t- user language preferences \n\t\t\t- user theme preferences \n\t\t\t- etc\n### fetch\n- to actually send requests from frontend to backend \n- hitting the endpoint either by a browser or insomnia \n- how to send a request when the button is sent.\n- part of browser API , to hit to the backend server \n- browsers expose something call fetch that hits the backend servers.\n- ![Screenshot 2026-01-21 at 6.47.06 PM.png](/images/posts/100xdevs-backend-basics-2-Screenshot-2026-01-21-at-6.47.06-PM.png)\n- using the `fetch` api globally to fetch the responses \n- on right clicking and clicking on the console, we can see the response.\n- Eg: using the `faker` api , we can try for free some data and see their response.\n- whenever the data resolves, the promise should reach there.\n- fetch will return a Promise and using the promisified response to resolve based on that.\n### Databases\n- until now, we have been storing data in memory , bad for a few reasons\n\t- data can't be dynamic , if we update in memory objects, the updates are lost if the process restarts \n\t- there are multiple servers in the real world \n- databases also support for querying and for optimized storage of the data.\n- In the real world, you dont have a single backend server, you have a cluster\n\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-21 at 9.00.31 PM.png](/images/posts/100xdevs-backend-basics-2-Screenshot-2026-01-21-at-9.00.31-PM.png)\n\t- for most purposes we have multiple servers and connected to a single db (well not really in prod!), but still\n\t- BE server fleet do business logic, do auth and other things.\n\t- user hits the backend \n\t- backend hits the database \n\t- user doesnt have access to the database/ can't talk to the DB.\n- how is the db exposed, how does be knows where to connect and etc?\n\t- only the backend server knows the URL of the databases\n\t- need to store secrets and also other things \n- there are various types of databases, depending on querying and the type of data that we want to store \n\t- graph dbs \n\t- vector dbs \n\t- sql dbs \n\t- nosql dbs\n- very famous nosql db -> mongodb \n#### MongoDB\n- MongoDB lets us create databases\n- In each DB, it lets us create tables(collections)\n- in each table, it lets us dump JSON data.\n- It is schemaless\n- It scales well and is a decent choice for most use cases.\n- How to work with it ?\n\t- create a mongodb instance \n\t- get our mongodb connection URL \n\t- download mongodb compass and explore the DB\n- while creating databases we have to create database-table and a collection name for the same.\n\t- can create multiple database and create multiple collections(tables)\n- create a new signup endpoint that users can come and hit it to enter the details to our database.\n- can then do CRUD operations in the database.\n- How does backend connects to the database ?\n\t- using libraries !\n\t- express lets u create an HTTP server\n\t- jsonwebtokens library lets us create jwts\n\t- mongoose lets us connect to your database\n- mongodb is schemaless, but for normal CRUD operations we need some abstraction to add to item to a mongodb database \n\t- use the mongoose library to give schema and structure to it.\n ",

    "content": "###  course notes for 100xDev Javascript Fundamentals.\n-  why languages ?\n\t- computer has ram and storage.\n\t- whenever we have application locally resides in the SSD\n\t- when we run something -- it runs in RAM\n\t- the current things in RAM, other things in SSD \n\t- what exactly goes to RAM? Some hardware and circuits - machine at the lowest level only understands a bunch of numbers \n\t- RAM doesnt understand programming languages -> represented by 0s and 1s.\n\t- Using something called compilers -> high level code , compiled to 0s and 1s. by the compiler. Much easier to run for loops, 0s and 1s. High level need of a programming language.\n\t- Every language has a compiler which convers the developer code into binary.\n\t- Compilers -> converts high level developer code into binary\n- Interpreted vs compiled languages \n\t- C++ is compiled -> compiles the code into binary by the compiler\n\t- JS is interpreted directly. No specific compilation step\n\t- Goes line by line ; doesn't worry about high level compilation of the whole thing\n\t\t-  usually goes line by line \n\t\t- can run partially if the error comes later\n- why JS >> Other languages in some use-cases\n\t- browsers can only understand HTML/CSS/JS.\n\t- Due to Node.js , Javascript can also be used for \"Backend Development\".\n\t- Javascript is loosely typed and it allows us to changes the types of the variables.\n\t- Project might have runtime errors -> leads to use of Typescript.\n\t\t- makes js more static -> same things that we see here, added into Javascript.\n\t- Strict vs Dynamic Languages\n- Single Threaded nature of JS \n\t- JS is a single threaded language.\n\t- the number of cores -> one of the specs of a new machine.\n\t- one single core -> run code at a single time.\n\t- the more the number of cores that we have, the more the number of processes that we can run.\n\t- there is something called context switching -> not everything needs the RAM right now.\n\t- It is some place that can run some code at the single time.\n\t- Cannot run parallely.\n\t- JS is always restricted to a single core.\n\t\t- cannot split our program to 2 cores , to split your loads and reduce load -> making it more optimal.\n\t\t- This is why it is considered to be a bad language for scalable systems.\n\t\t- Practically, JS runs line by line and only one line runs at a time. Go lets your create goroutines, JS doesn't.\n- Simple Primitives in JS(number, strings, booleans)\n\t- covered in the repo.\n- Complex Primitives in JS(arrays, objects)\n\t- arrays -> storage items of the same / different types.\n\t- objects -> key/value pairs of items and custom values.\n\t- arrays dont have to be of objects and can be of differnt types mixed together.\n- Functions in JS\n\t- lets us abstract out logic in our program.\n\t- take arguments in an input\n\t- return a value as an output\n\t- can think of them as an independent program that is supposed to do something given an input.\n\t- functions can take other functions as input -> callbacks.\n- Callback functions, event loop, callback queue, asynchronous programming \n\t- callback functions -> function take other functions as inputs \n\t- can change what function to get called, changed and pass the function as an argument.\n\t- passing a functions as an arguments.\n\t- inside the function, we are calling back some other functions \n\t- that's why its named as call back function.\n\t- Eg: setTimeout -> takes a function and calling it after sometime is a callback\n\t- Single Threaded -> only one thread available for the runtime to use \n\t- Non blocking call -> if we make an expensive network call / db call -> it will defer the call until the thread is free to do the execution.\n- Callback Hell and Promises \n- Basic JS APIs\n\t- JS refresher and practice for JS.\n- Classes \n\t- to abstract away repeated logic to keep an instance of an object \n\t- can add properties and methods on the instance\n\t- giving a structure that is reusable and used in multiple places.\n\t- define a blueprint of each item of that class.\n\t- can also have static functions on class \n\t\t- not associated to an object\n\t\t- associated with the blueprint itself.\n\t\t- can be called without instantiating a object.\n- Date Class\n\t- global date class given by JS.\n\t- present to use out of the box.\n- JSON\n\t- Javascript Object Notation.\n\t- `JSON.parse()` to extract the string into a valid JSON object\n\t- `JSON.stringify()` to encode the object into a string.\n\t- interchange bw strings and json using this \n\t- use case: when we get data from a server when we need to encode and decode the data -> stringify a data into a string , and while interacting with it , turn in back into object.\n- Math \n\t- `Math.random()` -> gives a random number bw 0 and 1 \n\t- `Math.floor()`\n\t- `Math.ceil()`\n\t- `Math.max()`\n\t- `Math.min()`\n- Objects\n\t- can set , unset properties on objects.\n\t- get the original object -> `obj` \n\t- get all the keys of the object -> `Object.keys(obj)`\n\t- get all the values of the object -> `Object.values(obj)`\n\t- get all the entries of the object -> `Object.entries(obj)` (key-value pairs)\n\t- check if the property of the object is its own or from parent node -> `obj.hasOwnProperty(\"property-name\")`\n\t- assign a new key and value to the object -> `Object.assign({},obj,{newProperty: \"newValue\"})`\n- Async functions vs Sync Functions \n\t- what does synchronous mean ?\n\t\t- together, one after the other or sequential \n\t\t- only one things is happening at a time \n\t\t- async -> opposite of async \n\t\t\t- happens in parts \n\t\t\t- multiple things are context switching with each other \n\t\t- eg: human body and brain is single threaded; we can only do one thing at a time -> but we can context switch b/w tasks , or we can delegaet tasks to other people.\n\t-  async functions \n\t\t- eg: filesystem access in nodejs \n\t\t- net amount of time take to do a task can be decreased using async functions (delegating and context switching)\n\t- setTimeout is like a global async function that JS provides that we can use it to check it.\n\t- part of the browser api , very common use \n\t- running a specific function after a duration (in ms)\n\t```javascript \n\tsetTimeout(() => {\n\t\tconsole.log(\"ok\")},1000\n\t);\n\t```\n\t- one way to make an async function synchronous is to use busywaiting \n\t - ```javascript \n\t  function syncSleep() {\n\t\t  let a = 1;\n\t\t  for(let i=0;i<10000000;i++) {\n\t\t  a++;\n\t\t  }\n\t }\n\t  \n\t  syncSleep();\n\t  ```\n  - we can defer the execution of this , by delaying it for some time. \n  - what are the common async functions ?\n\t  - `setTimeout()`\n\t  - `fs.readFile` to read a file from your filesystem \n\t\t  - async , because can't read a file immediately\n\t\t  - can take some time to access the file \n\t\t  - other process might be executing it\n\t\t  - you yourself might be editing it \n\t\t  - when done reading , it will call a callback to us \n\t- `fetch` to fetch some data from an API endpoint \n\t\t- async call -> getting data from someone's elses server.\n- the console.log after `fs.readFile` is executed function, cause accessing the file takes time, and `fs.readFile` is anyway asynchronous\n\t- and since it is expensive and async, we proceed do our own thing.\n- Real world use of callbacks \n- JS  Architecture in the Browser\n\t- check this out : http://latentflip.com/loupe/\n\t- call stack where your code gets places if its synchronous \n\t- callback queue \n\t\t- when we become idle, the event loop finally runs \n\t\t- checks if something there in the callback queue or not and then puts it in the callstack\n\t- every line of reaching there, is reaching the callstack -> what is being put on the stack to run that.\n\t\t- only one thing put at a time if all of our code is synchronous.\n\t\t- otherwise , the asynchronous code is not put there \n\t\t- when the loop finally exists, the stack can be popped.\n\t\t- if we only have synchronous code, all the code is placed on the call stack.\n\t- for async code:\n\t\t- events pushed to callback queue, until the thread is busy.\n\t\t- it will be kept waiting, when the call stack is empty, the callback queue will then put the event back into the callback queue.\n\t\t- if there is some async task that is completed, it gets pulled from callback queue to the call stack.\n- Promises\n\t- How can we create an asynchronous function of our own ?\n\t- usually all async function that well write will be on top of JS provided async functions like `setTimeout` of `fs.readFile`\n\t- leaner way to write it is to use promises than callbacks.\n\t- rather than user giving a callback to the next one, we use the `.then` method on the promise to resolve it after it has been successful.\n\t- the data of the promise comes asynchronously when loading the `.then` is called  to know where to send the data.\n\t\t- to know the next party knows that the data is here.\n\t- Promise is just like a class -like Date class.\n\t\t- when we initialize it , we have to give the first argument as function and the argument is the resolve argument.\n\t\t- ```js\n\t\t  var d = new Promise(function(onDone){\n\t\t  resolve(\"some data\");\n\t\t  });\n\t\t  \n\t\t  function callback() {\n\t\t  console.log(d);\n\t\t  }\n\t\t  \n\t\t  d.then(callback);\n\t\t  ```\n\t\t- Promise can have 3 states possible ->`Pending`, `Resolved` ,`Rejected`. \n\t\t- `.then()` method called on this promise when it is being resolves.\n\t\t- Just a class introduced to cleanup callbacks and to write async way.\n- Async Await \n\t- Much more cleaner way \n\t- Syntactic sugar , under the hood still using callbacks.\n\t```js\n\tfunction sagniksAsyncFunction() {\n\tlet p = new Promise(function(resolve) => {\n\tresolve(\"hi there\")};\n\treturn p;\n\t)};\n\t\n\tasync function main() {\n\t\tconst value = awit sagniksAsyncFunction(); \n\t\tconsole.log(value);\n\t};\n\t\n\tawait main();\n\t```\n\t- 2 keywords and removes the use of all the `.then` syntax and no callbacks syntax is required any more.\n\t- This control will not go beyond the log.\n\t- Under the hood it is the same exact logic and the thread is not blocked, it will just queue the async tasks.\n- Map,Filter and Arrow Functions:\n\t-  Map, filter are helper functions when it comes to arrays.\n\t\t- map\n\t\t\t- define the transformation that we need to do in a function is added in the function \n\t\t\t- map is a global function , on the array class, whose first function is a callback and then maps that number with the result.\n\t\t\t- maps the result with a initial input with a transformation function and maps to a new result in memory.\n\t\t- filter \n\t\t\t- it filters an array based on some predicate on the array class.\n\t\t\t- makes the syntax slightly cleaner.\n\t- Arrow functions are another way to write functions in JS.\n\t\t- arrow functions and normal functions are almost same, except when used in callbacks, when it can change.\n\t\t- there is a difference in the bindiung of normal functions and arrow functions.\n\t",

    "content": "#### Nodejs and its Runtime \n- ECMAScript vs Javascript \n\t- very significant difference \n\t- ECMAScript is a specification on which Javascript is based on.\n\t- guidelines and rules on which it is based.\n\t- everything that the JS engine / runtime should support \n\t- eg: ES2017, ESNext etc. are some of the specification \n- Javascript \n\t- javascript is the implementation.\n\t- not all of the things are used in the js runtime like setTimeout , Date etc. are part of the browser , nodejs provides us etc.\n\t- Multiple compilers for JS\n\t\t- V8 -> Google Chrome \n\t\t- SpiderMonkey -> Firefox\n\t\t- V8 -> is completely open source engine for the browser\n- Nodejs \n\t- JS was meant for the browser and anytime some wants to create website, made using HTML,CSS and JS.\n\t- Nobody used JS to create the backend\n\t- Take the V8 engine , add some extra functionality and utility, make JS as a backend language.\n\t- JS is easier to understand also and also is good runtime -> that can run JS.\n\t- Faster development cycle than Java, C# etc.\n\t- Bun is the faster alternative of Node.js\n\t- Bun is written in Zig. \n\t- Outperforms Nodejs in a bunch of tests and metrics.\n- Bun is highly backward compatible to Nodejs and eventually we can shift to it.\n\n#### What can we do in Nodejs ?\n- Create CLIs\n- Create a video player\n- Create a game \n- Create an HTTP server\n\n#### What is an HTTP server ?\n- Most popular use case of Nodejs\n- Hyper Text Transfer Protocol\n\t- A protocol that is defined for machines to communicate \n\t- Specifically for websites, it is the most common way for our website's frontend to talk to its backend.\n- Most common way for a website's frontend to talk to the  backend.\n- we can write the http server in nodejs and can deploy it anywhere.\n- Javascript -> used for frontend, Nodejs -> used for backend \n- Big picture:\n\t- Client throwing some information at a server \n\t- server doing something with that information \n\t- server responding back with the final result \n- Things client needs to worry about :\n\t- Protocol -> HTTP/WS/HTTPS\n\t- Address -> IP and port \n\t- Route \n\t- Headers / Body / Query Parameters \n\t- Method \n- Things the server needs to worry about:\n\t- Response Headers \n\t- Response Body \n\t- Status Codes\n- HTTP Protocol: \n\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-19 at 5.55.03 PM.png](/images/posts/100xdevs-backend-basics-Screenshot-2026-01-19-at-5.55.03-PM.png)\n\t- routes -> specifies what exactly what we want to do\n\t- headers -> some information we sent, most imp being authentication information, through cookies , one of many headers\n\t- body -> main argument that we send as a request that we sent out\n\t- method -> what kind of request that we are sending -> POST,GET,PUT, DELETE etc.\n\t- sticky sessions created using the token and that saved in cookies , makes the reason we dont need to login for each time.\n\t- response body -> where we get back the response from the server \n\t- status code -> status result  eg: 404 NOT FOUND \n\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-19 at 6.02.00 PM.png](/images/posts/100xdevs-backend-basics-Screenshot-2026-01-19-at-6.02.00-PM.png)\n\t- Good convention to follow the status code according to the actions that we are performing.\n\t- **What happens when you press enter in google.com ?**\n\t\t- Browser parses the URL\n\t\t- Does a DNS lookup i.e converts google.com to an IP address\n\t\t- Establishes a connection to the IP address (does a handshake)\n\t- **DNS Resolution**\n\t\t- URLs are just like contacts in our phone \n\t\t- In the end, they will map to an IP\n\t\t- If we ever buy a URL of our own, we would need to point it to the iP of our server.\n\t- Things that happens on your server after the request is received:\n\t\t- You get the inputs (route,body,headers)\n\t\t- You do some logic on the input, calculate the output \n\t\t- You return the output body, headers and status codes.\n\t- Common methods you can send to the BE server\n\t\t- GET \n\t\t- POST \n\t\t- PUT \n\t\t- DELETE \n\t- Common status codes the backend responds with \n\t\t- 200 - everything is OK \n\t\t- 404 - page / route is not found \n\t\t- 403 - authentication issues \n\t\t- 500 - internal server error \n\t- While we dont technically need status codes and just return in the body something like success: true/false , these are standard practices , we don't need all of it, but it is what is mentioned in the spec and hence is good to follow.\n\n#### Express\n- An library to create HTTP/HTTPS web servers in Node.js\n- The first one to kick things off.\n- TODO!: Create an HTTP server from scratch in Javascript using the inbuilt library.\n- we are using their high level APIs to create an interface to connect.\n```js \nconst express = require('express');\nconst port = 3000;\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.get('/',(req,res) => {\nres.send('hello world');\n});\n\n//listens on this port\napp.listen(port,() => {\n\tconsole.log(`running on http://localhost:${port}`);\n});\n```\n- it creates an instance of express and we are doing a get request on the / endpoint.\n- and then we listen to the endpoint at port 3000.\n- we use `app.use(express.json())` to create an middleware and use it to parse the JSON.\n- then using the req we can parse the methods as:\n```js\napp.post(\"/add-todo\", (req, res) => {\n\nconst { todoItem, todoDate } = req.body;\nconsole.log(`Recevied Todo: `, req.body);\ntodos.push({ todoItem: todoItem, todoDate: todoDate });\nres.status(201).json({\nmessage: \"Todo Added successfully\",\ndata: { todoItem, todoDate },\n});\n});\napp.get(\"/all-todos\", (req, res) => {\nres.json(todos);\n});\n```\n\n- when sending post request, people can send some data along !\n\t- in the body, in the headers etc.\n- can access the headers using the `req.headers` argument.\n\t- which is an object that logs all the headers that i am sending \n\t- can access the authorization using `req.headers[\"authorization\"]`\n\t- can also check the body \n\t- can also check the tokens also.\n- express doesnt handle the body by default, it only handles the request\n- to actually handle the body inside, use a different library called bodyParser() to handle it -- express doesnt give it to us by default.\n\t- actually middlewares!\n\t- in any case body has some json , we use the middleware to first handle the body `app.use(bodyParser.json())` \n#### fetch api\n- `fetch(url,{method: methodType}).then(handler)`\n- used mostly by frontend to fetch from the backend API.\n\n### query parameters\n- one of the ways a user can give input when sending input.\n- after the final route , add `?` and start to add your parameters.\n- get the name as `req.query.name` , where `name` is the argument name passed.\n- high level api for building the hospital-server , in-memory.\n\t- GET -> going for a consultation to get check up -> get some data \n\t- POST -> going top get a new kidney inserted  -> add new data on the server \n\t- PUT -> going to get a kidney replaced -> update a data on a server\n\t- DELETE -> going to get a kidney removed. -> delete some data from the server \n- you should generally follow the best practices(generally) \n\t- however in real time it is not implemented for most cases.\n- Imp status codes\n\t- 200 -> everything went fine\n\t- 404 -> not found ; doctor is not there in the hospital\n\t- 500 -> mid surgery light went away \n\t- 411 -> inputs were incorrect eg: wrong person came to the surgery\n\t- 403 -> you are not allowed in the hospital.\n- input way to send get requests is query parameters\n- for post requests we send the data in the body.\n\t- this is my input and how do you get the body here \n\t- we need a quick way to test response -> use insomnia \n- good engineering practices is to do edge case tests and server checks\n\t- eg: what should happen if there are no kidneys to delete.\n\n",

    "content": "### Difference b/w an Data Engineer and and AI Engineer\n- Data Engineer -> making sure all the data is captured, ready for analysis , clean and can be used. \n- AI Engineer -> work on the AI aspect of the product , do prompt tuning, validate your model, verifiable rewards etc. \n### Docker For Data Engineering:\n- Docker is a way to separate what we have in our host machine and the application (that requires other software dependencies).\n- What we have in Docker container is completely isolated from host machine.\n- What we run has no effect from the host machine and has no effect from the host machine.\n- Simplest Docker Command to check if Docker installed correctly:\n\t- `docker run hello-world`\n\t- Can run with interactive terminal as `docker run -it ubuntu`\n\t\t- Whatever we do here is isolated from the host machine \n\t- To come back we do `docker run -it ubuntu` \n\t- But when we do this , the problem is the command is then not found.\n- Everytime we create an docker container from an Docker image.\n\t- An instance of the Docker image is created -> it contains a complete snapshot of the operating system.\n\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-18 at 11.48.05 AM.png](/images/migrated/data-engineering-zoomcamp/imgs/Screenshot%202026-01-18%20at%2011.48.05%20AM.png)\n\t- It is stateless and doesn't preserve the state.\n\t- Instead of Ubuntu we can also use the direct python image of 3.13 directly also.\n- When installing the Python 3.13 image :\n\t- python -> image name \n\t- 3.13.11-slim -> is the tag name \n- If we wanted the entry point to be a bash session and not python repl directly:\n\t- `docker run -it --entrypoint=bash python:3.13.11-slim`\n- We can see stopped containers (which are saved somewhere as)\n\t- `docker ps -a`\n\t- even if we do `rm -rf /`\n\t- lists all the docker images that we executed and they have all the state\n\t- can remove all the files as `docker ps -aq` -> gets the id\n\t\t- then run as ``docker rm `docker ps -aq` `\n- How to preserve state ?\n\t- let us have a dir `test` and it contains files in that directory\n\t- what if we need to have access to the files from our docker container ?\n- Executing a file from inside volumes:\n\t- We have a folder `test/`  that should be available for both host machine and the container.\n\t- Using volume mapping as : `docker run -it --entrypoint=bash -v $(pwd)/test:/app/test python:3.13.11-slim`\n\t- where `$(pwd)/test/` is the local fs directory where it is kept\n\t- and `/app/test` is where it is being mapped to in Docker.\n\t- remember this should be executed from `$(pwd)` and not inside from `$(pwd)/test`\n### Data Pipelines:\n- A data pipeline is a service that receives data as input and outputs more data.\n- Eg: reading a CSV file, transforming the data somehow and storing it as a table in a PostgreSQL database.\n- ![Screenshot 2026-01-18 at 1.17.04 PM.png](/images/migrated/data-engineering-zoomcamp/imgs/Screenshot%202026-01-18%20at%201.17.04%20PM.png)\n- We have CSV files and parses the CSV files and creates the parquert files -> takes in some input and produces some output.\n- Anything that can take data from one and put in some destination is called a data pipeline.\n#### Building a basic pipeline in `pipeline/pipeline.py`: \n- arguments to check data in month 12 using the sys module \n- using pandas to then visualize the data in the given month \n- then saving the data to parquet -> parquet is a binary format for data. optimized for csv \n- want a isolated environment for setting up pyarrow and parquet.\n- create an virtual environment for the environment , different from the virtual environment we have for the docker image.\n- easier to isolate one project from another \n- ![Screenshot 2026-01-18 at 1.35.58 PM.png](/images/migrated/data-engineering-zoomcamp/imgs/Screenshot%202026-01-18%20at%201.35.58%20PM.png)\n- using uv to manage creating virtual environments \n\t- `uv init --python 3.13`\n\t- it creates its own python and it will use the uv's python to manage the project and to add the dependencies.\n- now we create an new docker image , python 3.13 , pyarrow, pandas and when we run docker , we run this pipeline.py\n- `Dockerfile` is a special file that tells how we are gonna create the Docker container.\n- Run as `docker build -t test:pandas . \n\t- `-t` is the tag name that we need to pass \n\t- `.` is the directory we are targetting ; where Dockerfile is specifically\n\t- Then can run as `docker run -it --entrypoint=bash --rm test:pandas` \n\t\t- when we finish the docker sessions, we wont have the state saved somewhere \n\t\t- no have any dangling things left \n\t- Using `ENTRYPOINT` we can redefine where we want it to run it from next time.\n\t\t- `docker run -it --rm test:pandas 12`\n\t- in our local machine we used `uv` but in our docker image we didnt.\n\t\t- update our docker image  to copy from the host system to the docker image \n\t\t- `COPY --from=ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:latest /uv /bin/`\n\t\t- after doing this uv becomes available.\n\t\t- after copying this we run `RUN uv sync --locked` to have the same dependencies on the docker container \n\t\t- so the python env in our local and in docker will exactly will be the same.\n\t\t- we can pass the uv run command in the entrypoint\n\t\t- or better to use it in the env path\n\t\t- `ENV PATH=\"/code/.venv/bin:$PATH\"`\n#### Adding Postgres to our flow:\n  - Docker can help with specific version of Postgres for our setup.\n  -  Setting up basic postgres on docker:\n\t- ```docker run -it --rm -e POSTGRES_USER=\"root\" -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=\"root\" -e POSTGRES_DB=\"my_taxi\" -v ny_taxi_postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql -p 5432:5432 postgres:18```\n\t- `-e` flag are used to setup env variables \n\t- for postgres we are configuring it with a user , password and database name.\n\t- this is different from every container , the potential variables can be used.\n\t- `ny_taxi_postgres_data` will be a inner volume for Docker that we will not be able to see\n\t\t- with it we can preserve our data \n\t\t- we can put whatever data that we want , and save it and next time it would be there \n\t\t- The concept is the same with **volume mapping**\n\t\t\t- we have a host machine and we map it to a container \n\t\t- With **port mapping** \n\t\t\t- we have a port in host machine and we map it to a port in the container.\n\t\t\t-  we sent a request to `localhost:5432` , is actually sent to whatever is running to inside in the container.\n\t\t- pgcli\n\t\t\t- python tool to intertact with postgres \n\t\t\t- adding it as a dev dependency to the uv project.\n\t\t\t- not a main dependency, using this dependency to just interaction with dev,not dependent on production use case.\n\t\t\t- `uv run pgcli -h localhost -p 5432 -u root -d ny_taxi`\n\t- Flow of things till now :\n\t\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-18 at 7.01.38 PM.png](/images/migrated/data-engineering-zoomcamp/imgs/Screenshot%202026-01-18%20at%207.01.38%20PM.png)\n\t- Even if we disconnect from it now, it will still have all the data till now.\n\n#### Interactive Analysis of Our Data using Jupyter \n- adding `jupyter` as a dev dependency to see and analyze the data into a jupyter notebook and to see the dependency.\n- we want to use pandas to read a csv file -- which is present in remote -- nyt taxi dataset , which is in parquet.\n- useful engineering tip -> added the prefix to set the main route to download from and url to point to specific dataset we want \n\t\t- then use `pd.read_csv()` to download the specific url\n\t- can then look at the data using `df.head()` \n\t- now our goal is to put this data into postgres.\n\t- parquet also schemas in the datatype, but csv doesnt\n\t- so pandas is trying to infer this type somehow\n\t- so we use a custom datatype , so to remove the type not matching warning\n\t- ```python\n\t\t  dtype = {\n\t    \"VendorID\": \"Int64\",\n\t    \"passenger_count\":\"Int64\",\n\t    \"trip_distance\":\"float64\",\n\t    \"RatecodeID\":\"Int64\",\n\t    \"store_and_fwd_flag\":\"string\",\n\t    \"PULocationID\":\"Int64\",\n\t    \"DOLocationID\":\"Int64\",\n\t    \"payment_type\":\"Int64\",\n\t    \"fare_amount\":\"float64\",\n\t    \"extra\":\"float64\",\n\t    \"mta_tax\":\"float64\",\n\t    \"tip_amount\":\"float64\",\n\t    \"tolls_amount\":\"float64\",\n\t    \"improvement_surcharge\":\"float64\",\n\t    \"total_amount\":\"float64\",\n\t    \"congestion_surcharge\":\"float64\"\n\t}\n\t  ```\n\t- to add this in our postgres , we would need an ORM :`sqlalchemy` and also the `psyciog2-binary` which is the postgres driver for python.\n\t- first we create an engine in our jupyter notebook to ingest the data.\n\t- ```python \n\t  from sqlalchemy import create_engine\n\t  engine = create_engine(\"postgresql://root:root@localhost:5432/ny_taxi\")\n\t  ```\n\t  - add the schema only (without inserting data)\n     - ```python \n\t    df.head(0).to_sql(name='yellow_taxi_data',con=engine,if_exists='replace')\n\t    ```\n- now to save this data into postgres , we should save them in chunks , otherwise the datasets could be huge and we dont want to load them up in memory.\n- we define an iterator :\n\t- ```python \n\t  df_iter = pd.read_csv(url,dtype=dtype,parse_dates=parse_dates,\n\t  iterator=True,chunksize=100000)\n\t  ```\n\t- and then using a for loop we can iterate and push the data into the database.\n- can then insert and check progress using `tqdm`\n\t- ```python \n\t  for df_chunk in tqdm(df_iter):\n\t\tdf_chunk.to_sql(name='yellow_taxi_data',con=engine,if_exists='append')\n\t  ```\n\n#### Optimized Data Ingestion\n- generate a script from the jupyter notebook and create an ingestion pipeline \n- refactored into clean ingestion pipeline that can be run with a single command.\n\t- `python pipeline/ingest_data.py`\n#### Making a Better command line interface using click\n- Using `click` to make a better command line interface to use our parameters to get the data and make it better.\n\n\n#### Architecture till now:\n- ![Screenshot 2026-01-18 at 9.46.25 PM.png](/images/migrated/data-engineering-zoomcamp/imgs/Screenshot%202026-01-18%20at%209.46.25%20PM.png)\n- when we try to connect to the localhost , it is trying to connect to the localhost internally to docker not to our local.\n- need to create using `docker network`\n- things within the same network can see each other.\n\t- `pgdatabase` in `postgres:18` container \n\t- `taxi_ingest:v001` in `ingest` container \n\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-18 at 9.53.50 PM.png](/images/migrated/data-engineering-zoomcamp/imgs/Screenshot%202026-01-18%20at%209.53.50%20PM.png)\n\t- they can then see each other and can also access ports of each other.\n\t- after resolving this, we added pgAdmin to run in the same network to get a better UI.\n\t- After adding pgadmin:\n\t\t- ![Screenshot 2026-01-18 at 10.04.45 PM.png](/images/migrated/data-engineering-zoomcamp/imgs/Screenshot%202026-01-18%20at%2010.04.45%20PM.png)\n#### docker-compose\n- to execute both the services db up and setup pgAdmin together.\n- creates volumes and networks\n\n\n### SQL Refresher \n- ",

    "content": "\n_Note: For reading through this lecture, first go through : [[Python From Scratch]]_\n\n### OOP:\n\n- [Object-Oriented Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming), or \"OOP\", is a pattern for writing clean and maintainable code. Not everyone *agrees* that object-oriented principles are the best way to write code, but, to be a good engineer, you should at least understand them.\n\n### Clean Code:\n\n- Paradigms like [object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) and [functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) are all about making code easier to work with and understand as the feeble humans we are. Code that's easy for humans to understand is called \"clean code\".\n- Clean Code does not:\n  - Make your programs run faster\n  - Make your programs function correctly\n  - Only occur in object-oriented programming\n- Clean Code does:\n  - Make code easier to work with\n  - Make it easier to find and fix bugs\n  - Make the development process faster\n  - Help us retain our sanity\n\n### Dry Code:\n\n- Another \"rule of thumb\" for writing maintainable code is \"Don't Repeat Yourself\" (DRY). It just means that, when possible, you should avoid writing the same code in multiple places. Repeating code can be bad because:\n  - If you need to change it, you have to change it in multiple places\n  - If you forget to change it in one place, you'll have a bug\n  - It's more work to write it over and over again\n\n### Classes:\n\n- A [class](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html) is a special type of value in an object-oriented programming language like Python. It's similar to a dictionary in that it usually stores other types inside itself.\n\n```python\n# Defines a new class called \"Soldier\"\nclass Soldier:\n    health = 5\n    armor = 3\n    damage = 2\n```\n\n- Just like a string, integer or float, a class is a *type*, but instead of being a built-in type, your classes are custom types that you define.\n- An object is just an [instance](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20461907/what-is-meaning-of-instance-in-programming) of a class type. For example:\n\n```python\nhealth = 50\n# health is an instance of an integer type\naragorn = Soldier()\n# aragorn is an instance of the Soldier type (class)\n```\n\n- \"Classes\" are custom new types that we define as the programmer. Each new instance of a class is an \"object\".\n\n### Methods:\n\n- you might be wondering *why* classes are useful, they're like [dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries)... but worse!\n- One thing that makes classes cool is that we can define [methods](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#method-objects) on them. A method is a function that's tied directly to a class and has access to all its properties.\n- self:\n  - Methods are nested within the `class` declaration. Their first parameter is always the instance of the class that the method is being called on. By convention, it's called [\"self\"](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-method). Because `self` is a reference to the object, you can use it to read and update the properties of the object.\n  - Notice that methods are called directly on an object using the dot operator.\n\n```python\nmy_object.my_method()\n```\n\n- methods can return values:\n  - n contrast, methods often don't return anything explicitly because they can mutate the properties of the object instead. That's exactly what we did in the last assignment.\n  - However, they *can* return values if you want! They're just functions with access to an object, after all.\n\n### Methods vs Functions:\n\n- A method has all the same properties as a function, but it is tied directly to a class and has access to all its properties.\n- A method *automatically* receives the object it was called on as its first parameter.\n- A method can operate on data that is contained within the class. In other words, you won't always see all the \"outputs\" in the `return` statement because the method might just mutate the object's properties directly.\n- Because functions are more explicit, some developers argue that [functional programming](https://blog.boot.dev/clean-code/benefits-of-functional-programming/) is better than object-oriented programming. In reality, neither paradigm is \"better\", and the best developers learn and understand both styles and use them as they see fit.\n\n### Constructor:\n\n- It's more practical to use a [constructor](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructor_(object-oriented_programming)>). In Python, if you name a method [`__init__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__init__), that's the constructor and it is called when a new object is created.\n- So, with a constructor, the code would look like this:\n\n```python\nclass Soldier:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.name = \"Legolas\"\n        self.armor = 2\n        self.num_weapons = 2\n```\n\n- Now we can make the starting armor and number of weapons configurable with some parameters!\n\n```python\nclass Soldier:\n    def __init__(self, name, armor, num_weapons):\n        self.name = name\n        self.armor = armor\n        self.num_weapons = num_weapons\n\nsoldier = Soldier(\"Legolas\", 5, 10)\nprint(soldier.name)\n# prints \"Legolas\"\nprint(soldier.armor)\n# prints \"5\"\nprint(soldier.num_weapons)\n# prints \"10\"\n```\n\n### Multiple Objects:\n\n- So for our wall class, I can create three different \"instances\" of the class. Or, in other words, I can create three separate objects.\n\n```python\nwall_maria = Wall(1, 2, 3)\nwall_rose = Wall(4, 5, 6)\nwall_sina = Wall(9, 8, 7)\n```\n\n- Objects are an instance of a class.\n\n### Class Variables vs Instance Variables:\n\n- Instance variables vary from object to object and are **declared in the constructor.**\n\n```python\nclass Wall:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.height = 10\n\nsouth_wall = Wall()\nsouth_wall.height = 20 # only updates this instance of a wall\nprint(south_wall.height)\n# prints \"20\"\n\nnorth_wall = Wall()\nprint(north_wall.height)\n# prints \"10\"\n```\n\n- Class variables remain the same between instances of the same class and are **declared at the top level of a class definition**.\n\n```python\nclass Wall:\n    height = 10\n\nsouth_wall = Wall()\nprint(south_wall.height)\n# prints \"10\"\n\nWall.height = 20 # updates all instances of a Wall\n\nprint(south_wall.height)\n# prints \"20\"\n```\n\n- In other languages these types of variables are often called [static variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_variable).\n\n- Variables, fields and properties\n  - The terms instance and class variable, field, property and attribute are used interchangeably and usually refer to the same concept in languages that support some form of object-oriented programming. Here's a quick reference for some popular languages:\n\n| Language   | Class variable | Instance variable |\n| ---------- | -------------- | ----------------- |\n| Python     | Class variable | Instance variable |\n| Go         | Field          | Field             |\n| JavaScript | Property       | Property          |\n| C#         | Static field   | Field             |\n| Java       | Static field   | Field             |\n\n- Which should I use?\n  - Generally speaking, *stay away from class variables*. Just like global variables, class variables are usually a bad idea because they make it hard to keep track of which parts of your program are making updates. However, it is important to understand how they work because you may see them out in the wild.\n\n### Encapsulation:\n\n- [Encapsulation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)>) is the practice of hiding complexity inside a [\"black box\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box) so that it's easier to focus on the problem at hand.\n- The most basic example of encapsulation is a function. The caller of a function doesn't need to worry too much about what happens inside, they just need to understand the inputs and outputs.\n\n```python\nacceleration = calc_acceleration(initial_speed, final_speed, time)\n```\n\n- To use the `calc_acceleration` function, we don't need to think about every individual line of code inside the function. We just need to know that if we give it the inputs:\n  - `initial_speed`\n  - `final_speed`\n  - `time`\n- Then it will give us the correct `acceleration` as an output.\n- By default, all properties and methods in a class are *public*. That means that you can access them with the `.` operator:\n\n```python\nwall.height = 10\nprint(wall.height)\n# 10\n```\n\n- [Private](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html#tut-private) data members are how we encapsulate logic and data within a class. To make a property or method private, you just need to prefix it with two underscores.\n\n```python\nclass Wall:\n    def __init__(self, armor, magic_resistance):\n        self.__armor = armor\n        self.__magic_resistance = magic_resistance\n\n    def get_defense(self):\n        return self.__armor + self.__magic_resistance\n\nfront_wall = Wall(10, 20)\n\n# This results in an error\nprint(front_wall.__armor)\n\n# This works\nprint(front_wall.get_defense())\n```\n\n- Encapsulation is the practice of hiding code complexity inside a [\"black box\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box) so that other developers working with the code don't have to worry about it.\n- To be clear, it does *not* make the code more secure in a cryptographic or cyber-security sense. That's a point I was personally confused about when I was first learning about private and public class members.\n- **Encapsulation is about organization, not security.**\n- Encapsulation is like folders in an unlocked filing cabinet. They don't stop someone from peeking inside, but they do keep everything tidy and easy to find.\n\n### Encapsulation in Python\n\n- Python is a dynamic language, and that makes it difficult for the interpreter to enforce some of the safeguards that languages like [Go](https://go.dev/) do. That's why encapsulation in Python is achieved mostly by [convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions) rather than by *force*.\n- Prefixing methods and properties with a double underscore is a *strong* suggestion to the users of your class that they shouldn't be touching that stuff. If a developer wants to break convention, [there are ways to get around](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3385317/private-variables-and-methods-in-python) the double underscore rule.\n\n```python\nclass Wall:\n    def __init__(self, height):\n        # the double underscore make this a private property\n        # but it's not strictly enforced, there are hacks to get around it\n        self.__height = height\n\n    def get_height(self):\n        return self.__height\n```\n\n### Abstraction:\n\n- Abstraction helps us handle complexity by hiding unnecessary details. Sounds like encapsulation, right? They're so similar that it's almost not worth worrying about the difference...almost.\n- Abstraction vs encapsulation\n  - Abstraction is about *creating a simple interface for complex behavior.* It focuses on what's exposed.\n  - Encapsulation is about *hiding internal state.* It focuses on tucking implementation details away so no one depends on them.\n- Abstraction is more about reducing complexity, encapsulation is more about maintaining the integrity of system internals.\n- Are we encapsulating or abstracting?\n- Both. Almost always we are doing both. Here's an example of using the `random` library to generate a random number:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\nattack_damage = random.randrange(5)\n```\n\n- Abstraction is about reducing complexity. Creating good abstractions is particularly crucial when you're developing libraries for other developers to use. For example, the built-in `pow` function in Python is an abstraction that hides the complexity of calculating exponents.\n\n### OOP Thinking:\n\n- lasses in object-oriented programming are all about grouping data and behavior *together* in one place: an *object*. Object-oriented programmers tend to think about programming as a modeling problem. They think:\n  > \"How can I write a `Human` class that holds the **data** and simulates the **behavior** of a real human?\"\n- To provide some contrast, functional programmers tend to think of their code as inputs and outputs, and how those inputs and outputs transition the world from one state to the next:\n  > \"When a human takes a step, what's the new state of the game?\"\n- OOP isn't the only pattern for organizing code, but it's one of the more popular ones. If you understand multiple ways of thinking about code, you'll be a much better developer overall.\n\n### Inheritance:\n\n- [inheritance](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)>). Non-OOP languages like Go and Rust allow for encapsulation and abstraction features as nearly *every* language does. Inheritance, on the other hand, tends to be unique to class-based languages like Python, Java, and Ruby.\n- Inheritance allows one class, the \"child\" class, to *inherit* the properties and methods of another class, the \"parent\" class.\n- This powerful language feature helps us avoid writing a lot of the same code twice. It allows us to [DRY (don't repeat yourself)](https://blog.boot.dev/clean-code/dry-code/) up our code.\n- Here `Cow` is a \"child\" class that inherits from the \"parent\" class `Animal`:\n\n```python\nclass Animal:\n    # parent \"Animal\" class\n\nclass Cow(Animal):\n    # child class \"Cow\" inherits \"Animal\"\n```\n\n- `Cow` class can reuse the `Animal` class's constructor with the [super()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#super) method, `super()` allows the child class to call methods and constructors from its parent class, in this case, `__init__()`:\n\n```python\nclass Animal:\n    def __init__(self, num_legs):\n        self.num_legs = num_legs\n\nclass Cow(Animal):\n    def __init__(self, num_udders):\n        # call the parent constructor to give the cow some legs\n        super().__init__(4)\n\n        # set cow specific properties\n        self.num_udders = num_udders\n```\n\n- Inheritance is a powerful tool, but it is a *really* bad idea to try to overuse it. Inheritance should only be used when all instances of a child class are also instances of the parent class.\n- When a child class inherits from a parent, it inherits *everything*. If you only want to share *some* functionality, inheritance is probably not the best answer. Better to simply share some functions, or maybe make a new parent class that both classes can inherit from.\n- A good child class is a strict [subset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subset) of its parent class.\n- An example of this with private properties. A child class cannot simply access a private property of its parent class. It has to use a getter.\n\n```python\nclass Wall:\n    def __init__(self, height):\n        self.__height = height\n\n    def get_height(self):\n        return self.__height\n\nclass Castle(Wall):\n    def __init__(self, height, towers):\n        super().__init__(height)\n        self.towers = towers\n\n    def get_tower_height(self):\n        return self.get_height() * 2\n```\n\n### Multiple Children:\n\n- So far we've worked with linear class inheritance, but usually, inheritance hierarchies form trees, not lines. A parent class can have multiple children.\n\n### why inheritance trees wide instead of deep ?\n\n-  in good software a child class is a strict subset of its parent class. In a deep tree, that means the children need to be perfect members of all the parent class \"types\". That simply doesn't happen very often in the real world. It's much more likely that you'll have a base class that simply has many sibling classes that are slightly different variations of the base.\n\n### Polymorphism:\n\n- While inheritance is the most unique trait of object-oriented languages, polymorphism is probably the most powerful. Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms.\n  - \"poly\"=\"many\"\n  - \"morph\"=\"form\".\n- For example, classes in the same hierarchical tree may have methods with the *same* name but *different* behaviors.\n- Different Forms\n- Let's look at a simple example.\n\n```python\nclass Creature():\n    def move(self):\n        print(\"the creature moves\")\n\nclass Dragon(Creature):\n    def move(self):\n        print(\"the dragon flies\")\n\nclass Kraken(Creature):\n    def move(self):\n        print(\"the kraken swims\")\n\nfor creature in [Creature(), Dragon(), Kraken()]:\n    creature.move()\n# prints:\n# the creature moves\n# the dragon flies\n# the kraken swims\n```\n\n- The `Dragon` and `Kraken` child classes are **overriding** the behavior of their parent class's `move()` method.\n\n- Polymorphism in programming is the ability to present the same interface (function or method signatures) for many different underlying forms (data types).\n\n- A classic example is a `Shape` class that `Rectangle`, `Circle`, and `Triangle` can inherit from. With polymorphism, each of these classes will have different underlying data. The circle needs its center point coordinates and radius. The rectangle needs two coordinates for the top left and bottom right corners. The triangle needs coordinates for the corners.\n\n- By making each class responsible for its data **and** its code, you can achieve polymorphism. In the shapes example, each class would have its own `draw_shape()` method. This allows the code that uses the different shapes to be simple and easy, and more importantly, it can treat shapes as the **same** even though they are **different**. It hides the complexities of the difference behind a clean abstraction.\n- If you change the function signature of a parent class when overriding a method, it could be a disaster. The whole point of overriding a method is so that the caller of your code *doesn't have to worry* about what different things are going on inside the methods of different object types.\n- Another kind of built-in polymorphism in Python is the ability to override how an operator works. For example, the `+` operator works for built-in types like integers and strings.\n\n```python\nprint(3 + 4)\n# prints \"7\"\n\nprint(\"three \" + \"four\")\n# prints \"three four\"\n```\n\n- Custom classes on the other hand don't have any built-in support for those operators:\n\n```python\nclass Point:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n\np1 = Point(4, 5)\np2 = Point(2, 3)\np3 = p1 + p2\n# TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'Point' and 'Point'\n```\n\n-  If we create an `__add__(self, other)` method on our class, the Python interpreter will use it when instances of the class are being added with the `+` operator. Here's an example:\n\n```python\nclass Point:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n    def __add__(self, point):\n        x = self.x + point.x\n        y = self.y + point.y\n        return Point(x, y)\n\np1 = Point(4, 5)\np2 = Point(2, 3)\np3 = p1 + p2\n# p3 is (6, 8)\n```\n\n- As we discussed in the last assignment, operator overloading is the practice of defining custom behavior for standard Python operators. Here's a list of how the operators translate into method names.\n\n| Operation          | Operator | Method       |\n| ------------------ | -------- | ------------ |\n| Addition           | +        | **add**      |\n| Subtraction        | -        | **sub**      |\n| Multiplication     | \\*       | **mul**      |\n| Power              | \\*\\*     | **pow**      |\n| Division           | /        | **truediv**  |\n| Floor Division     | //       | **floordiv** |\n| Remainder (modulo) | %        | **mod**      |\n\n<tr>\n<td>Bitwise Left Shift</td>\n<td>&lt;&lt;</td>\n<td><strong>lshift</strong></td>\n</tr>\n|Bitwise Right Shift|>>|__rshift__|\n|Bitwise AND|&|__and__|\n|Bitwise OR|\\||__or__|\n|Bitwise XOR|^|__xor__|\n|Bitwise NOT|~|__invert__|\n-  Overriding Built-in Methods\n\n- Last but not least, let's take a look at some of the built-in methods we can override in Python. While there isn't a default behavior for the arithmetic operators like we just saw, there *is* a default behavior for **printing** a class.\n\n```python\nclass Point:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n\np1 = Point(4, 5)\nprint(p1)\n```\n\n- That's not super useful! Let's teach instances of our `Point` object to print themselves. The [`__str__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__str__) method (short for \"string\") lets us do just that. It takes no inputs but returns a string that will be printed to the console when someone passes an instance of the class to Python's `print()` function.\n\n```python\nclass Point:\n    def __init__(self, x, y):\n        self.x = x\n        self.y = y\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"({self.x},{self.y})\"\n\np1 = Point(4, 5)\nprint(p1)\n# prints \"(4,5)\"\n```\n\n-\n",

When you use a mouse to click on fancy icons, buttons, and menus, you're using a GUI.\n\nTo be fair, it's usually easier to teach someone how to use a GUI than a CLI.

With a GUI you're limited to the options that the developer of the GUI has given you.\n- **They're slow.** Once you know the commands to type, it's much faster to type them than to click through endless menus with a mouse.\n- **They're not as reproducible.** If you want to share a set of instructions, you can just copy and paste commands without worrying about screen sizes and user preferences.\n- **They're not automatable.** It's easy to write code that manipulates text (as you've seen in Python), but it's much harder to write code that manipulates GUIs.\n- **They're not as cool.** You will be invited to 90% fewer romantic outings if you are a GUI user.\n\n### What is a terminal?\n\n- As we talked about, the terms \"shell\", \"CLI\", and \"terminal\" are often used to refer to the same thing: the program that lets you issue text-based commands.\n- However, to get pedantic, the \"terminal\" is just one *specific part* of that program. Historically, the word \"terminal\" meant a physical device that you could type commands into, essentially a keyboard and a screen.\n- A terminal emulator is a program that emulates a physical terminal. It's a program that lets you type commands into a window on your computer.\n- *Which* commands you're able to use isn't determined by the terminal emulator that you happen to be using. It's determined by the \"shell\", which we'll talk about later.\n\n### What is a shell?\n\n- So if your terminal is just a program that lets you issue text-based commands and renders the output of those commands...\n  ...What is the program that *runs* those commands???\n- That's a shell.\n- Shells do a lot of things, but their main job is to interpret the commands you type and execute them.\n- Shells are often referred to as \"REPL\"s. REPL stands for\n  - Read\n  - Eval (evaluate)\n  - Print\n  - Loop\n- This is a fancy way of saying that shells are programs that:\n  1.  Read the commands you type\n  2.  Evaluate those commands, usually by running other programs on your computer\n  3.  Print the output of those commands\n  4.  Give you a new prompt to type another command and repeat\n\n```bash\n# to eval a result\nexpr 123456 + 7890\n```\n\n### Variables:\n\n- Both Bash and Zsh are shells, and they also happen to be powerful programming languages. They have variables, functions, loops, and more. That said, only [crazy people](https://bashsta.cc/) write large programs in shell languages... shells are optimized for running other programs and writing small scripts, not for writing programs.\n\n```bash\nname=\"hello\"\n```\n\n```bash\nbankname=\"WorldBanc\"\nfounded=\"1969\"\nceo=\"Jeff Gates\"\necho \"$bankname was founded in $founded by $ceo\"\n```\n\n### History:\n\n- hen you're working in a REPL, it's *really* helpful to be able to see the commands you've typed in the past. That way you can easily re-run them, or copy and paste them into a script.\n\n```bash\nhistory\n```\n\n- You'll often want to re-run a command that you've run before. You could just type it out again, but assuming you don't have the [WPM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute) of ThePrimeagen, that's going to be a pain.\n- Instead, you can use the up and down arrows to cycle through your command history. Focus your terminal window and use the \"up\" arrow key to start cycling through your command history. If you recently restarted your terminal type a few commands first, like:\n\n```bash\necho hello\necho world\n```\n\n- If your terminal is feeling cluttered with text, you can clear it with the `clear` command, or by pressing `ctrl + l`.\n\n### FileSystems:\n\n- All the data stored on your computer is organized into files and directories. Files and directories are organized into a tree-like structure called a filesystem.\n- Directories (same as \"folders\" on Windows) are just containers that hold files and other directories.\n- Files are just a dump of raw binary data: 1's and 0's. The bytes in a file can represent anything: text, images, videos, etc.\n- The filesystem tree starts with a single directory called the [root directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_directory). The root directory contains files and directories, which can contain more files and directories, and so on.\n- When you open your terminal, your *working directory* (the one you're \"in\") is going to be... somewhere. Most commonly it is your [\"home\" directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory).\n\n```bash\n# get the working dir\npwd\n```\n\n- The output of your `pwd` command is a *filepath*. A filepath is a string that describes the location of a file or directory on your computer. Yours should look something like this:\n\n```\n/Users/wagslane\n```\n\n- The text might be different, but the structure should be the same. Let's break it down:\n  - The first slash (`/`) represents the *root directory*. It's the tippy-top of the filesystem tree.\n  - The next part (`Users`) is the name of a directory inside the root directory.\n  - Finally, the last part (`wagslane`) is the name of a directory inside the `Users` directory.\n- So this path represents a directory 2 levels down from the root directory:\n\n```\nroot\n  └── Users\n        └── wagslane\n```\n\n### Parent Directories:\n\n-  how you can \"change directory\" to move *into* a directory. But how do you move back *out* of a directory?\n- The answer is two dots: `..`\n- `..` is a special directory name that means \"the parent directory\". It's a shortcut that you can use to move up one level in the directory tree.\n\n### Absolute vs Relative Paths:\n\n- We've mostly been dealing with [relative filepaths](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/linux-path-absolute-relative) which are just paths that take into account your current directory.\n- For example, let's say we have the following directory structure in our filesystem:\n\n```\nvehicles\n├── cars\n│   ├── fords\n│   │   ├── mustang.txt\n│   │   └── focus.txt\n```\n\n- When inside the top-level `vehicles` directory, the relative path to the `mustang.txt` file is:\n\n```\ncars/fords/mustang.txt\n```\n\n- However, when we're inside the `cars` directory, the relative path to the `mustang.txt` file is just:\n\n```\nfords/mustang.txt\n```\n\n- Or when inside the `fords` directory, just:\n\n```\nmustang.txt\n```\n\n- An absolute path is a path that starts at the root of the filesystem. On [Unix-like systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix-like) (Mac OS/Linux/WSL), the root is denoted by a forward slash `/`. So, if the `vehicles` directory is in the filesystem root, the absolute path to the `mustang.txt` file is\n\n```\n/vehicles/cars/fords/mustang.txt\n```\n\n### Files:\n\n- At their core, files are just blobs of data. The raw bytes in a file can represent anything: text, images, videos, etc.\n- `cat` command is used to view the contents of a file. It's short for \"concatenate\", which is a fancy way of saying \"put things together\". It can feel like a confusing name if you're using the `cat` command to view a single file, but it makes more sense when you're using it to view multiple files at once.\n\n```bash\n# Print the contents of a file to the terminal\ncat file1.txt\n```\n\n- Sometimes you don't want to print *everything* in a file. Files can be really big after all.\n- The head command\n  - The [head](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=h-head-command) command prints the first `n` lines of a file, where `n` is a number you specify.\n\n```bash\nhead -n 10 file1.txt\n```\n\n- The tail command\n  - The [tail](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=t-tail-command) command prints the *last* `n` lines of a file, where `n` is a number you specify.\n\n```bash\ntail -n 10 file1.txt\n```\n\n- The [more](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=m-more-command) and [less](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/less.1.html) commands let you view the contents of a file, one page (or line) at a time.\n- As the adage goes, `less` is `more`.\n- In the context of these commands, `less` is *literally* `more`. The `less` command does everything that the `more` command does but also has more features. As a general rule, you should use `less` instead of `more`.\n- You would only use `more` if you're on a system that doesn't have `less` installed.\n- `less` command, but this time, pass in the `-N` flag to show line numbers:\n\n```bash\nless -N 2023.csv\n```\n\n- The [touch command](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/touch.1.html) is designed to update the access and modification timestamps of a file. By default, if the specified file does not exist, `touch` will create an empty file with the given filename. Because of this, you’ll often see this command used to quickly create new files.\n\n```bash\ntouch new_file.txt\n```\n\n- You can also create multiple files at once by listing them:\n\n```bash\ntouch some_file.txt some_other_file.txt\n```\n\n### Directories:\n\n- a directory is just a location in a filesystem that can contain files and other directories. On some systems, directories are called \"folders\", but it's the same thing.\n- The [\"make directory\" command](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=m-mkdir-command) creates a new directory inside the current directory.\n\n```bash\nmkdir my_directory\n```\n\n### Move:\n\n- The [move command](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=files-moving-renaming-mv-command) moves a file or directory from one location to another. You can use it to rename a file or to move it to a different directory altogether. Your working directory can't be the directory you're moving.\n- Renaming a file:\n\n```bash\nmv some_file.txt some_other_name.txt\n```\n\n- Moving a file from the current directory to another nested directory:\n\n```bash\nmv some_file.txt some_directory/some_file.txt\n```\n\n- Moving a file from the current directory, to the parent directory:\n\n```bash\nmv some_file.txt ../some_file.txt\n```\n\n- If you don't want to rename the file and you're just moving it to a different directory, you can omit the filename:\n\n```bash\nmv some_file.txt some_directory/\n```\n\n### Remove:\n\n- The [remove command](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=files-deleting-rm-command) deletes a file or empty directory:\n\n```bash\nrm some_file.txt\n```\n\n- You can optionally add a `-r` flag to tell the `rm` command to delete a directory and *all* of its contents recursively. \"Recursively\" is just a fancy way of saying \"do it again on all of the subdirectories and their contents\".\n\n```bash\nrm -r some_directory\n```\n\n### Copy:\n\n- [copy command](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=c-cp-command) does what you would (hopefully) expect: it copies a file from one location to another.\n\n```bash\ncp source_file.txt destination/\n```\n\n- You can also copy a directory and all of its contents recursively by adding the `-R` flag:\n\n```bash\ncp -R my_dir new_dir\n```\n\n### Home:\n\n- In a Unix-like operating system, a user's [home directory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory) is the directory where their personal files are stored. It is also the directory that a user starts in when logging into the system.\n- I recommend doing all of your development work in your home directory. For example, I like to create a `workspace` directory in my home directory, and all my projects live in subdirectories there.\n- Your home directory is where you want to spend most of your time. Many of the other directories on your machine are critical to the operating system or other programs. Be careful when working in [other directories](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=reference-directories) like `/bin`, `/etc`, `/var`, etc.\n- You can mess up your system if you're not careful.\n\n- The `~` alias\n  - My home directory (on Mac) is located at `/Users/wagslane`. The `~` character is an alias for your home directory. So when I want to go home, I don't have to type out `cd /Users/wagslane`, I can just type:\n\n```bash\ncd ~\n```\n\n### Grep:\n\n- You might be used to nice graphical interfaces that allow you to search for text in files, usually with `ctrl+f` or `cmd+f`. But what about when you're working on a terminal?\n- As it turns out, once you're used to it, searching for text in files on a CLI can be much faster than using a GUI.\n- The [grep command](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/grep-command-in-linux-unix) allows you to search for text in files. It has a *ton* of capability, and we'll only be scratching the surface of its true power.\n- Basic usage\n- The most basic usage of `grep` is to search for a string in a file. For example, if we wanted to search for the word \"hello\" in the file `hello.txt`, we could run:\n\n```bash\ngrep \"hello\" hello.txt\n```\n\n- You can also search multiple files at once. For example, if we wanted to search for the word \"hello\" in `hello.txt` and `hello2.txt`, we could run:\n\n```bash\ngrep \"hello\" hello.txt hello2.txt\n```\n\n- Recursive search\n- You can also search an entire directory, including all subdirectories. For example, if we wanted to search for the word \"hello\" in the current directory and all subdirectories, we could run:\n\n```bash\n# . is the current directory\ngrep -r \"hello\" .\n```\n\n### Find:\n\n- The `find` command is a powerful tool for finding files and directories by name, not by their contents.\n- Find a file by name\n  - Let's say you're looking for a file named `hello.txt` somewhere in your home directory. You can use the `find` command to search for exactly that title:\n\n```bash\nfind some_directory -name hello.txt\n```\n\n- Pattern search\n  - The `find` command can also search for files that match a pattern. For example, if you wanted to find all files that end in `.txt`, you could run:\n\n```bash\nfind some_directory -name \"*.txt\"\n```\n\n- The `*` character is a wildcard that matches anything. If you're trying to find filenames that *contain* a specific word, you can use the `*` character to match the rest of the filename:\n\n```bash\n# Find all filenames that contain the word \"chad\"\nfind some_directory -name \"*chad*\"\n```\n\n### Permissions:\n\n- Unix-like systems (like the one you're using) support multiple users. Each user has their own home directory, their own files, and their own permissions.\n- If you're like most people these days, you're the only user on your machine. It used to be more common for multiple people to share a single computer, or for multiple people to do their work on the same computer over a network.\n- `sudo` keyword lets you run a command as a \"superuser\". It's short for [\"superuser do\"](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/linux-101-introduction-sudo/). To use it, you'll need a password with superuser privileges, which you should already have if you're the only user of your machine\n- Some people are pedantic and pronounce `sudo` as \"sue-doo\". Others are correct and pronounce it \"sue-dough\".\n- First, run the [\"Who am I?\" command](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/3.1.0?topic=wtsc-using-whoami-command) to see which user you're logged in as:\n\n```bash\nwhoami\n```\n\n- In a Unix-like operating system, permissions control who can do what to which files and directories. The permissions of an individual file or directory are visually represented as a 10-character string:\n\n```\ndrwxrwxrwx\n```\n\n- Let's break down each character. The first one just tells you whether you're looking at a file or a directory:\n  - `-`: Regular file (e.g. `-rwxrwxrwx`)\n  - `d`: Directory (e.g. `drwxrwxrwx`)\n\n- The next 9 characters are broken up into 3 sets of `rwx` and represent the permissions themselves for the \"owner\", \"group\", and \"others\", in order. Each group of 3 represents the permissions for reading, writing, and executing, in order. So, for example:\n  - `rwx`: All permissions\n  - `rw-`: Read and write, but not execute\n  - `r-x`: Read and execute, but not write\n  - The first 3 characters are \"owner\" permissions. The \"owner\" is usually just the user who created the file or directory, but it can be manually changed.\n  - The next 3 characters are \"group\" permissions. Unix-like systems support groups of users and a file or directory can be assigned to a single group. To be honest, unless you're a system administrator, you won't often worry about groups.\n  - The last 3 characters are \"others\" permissions. This is everyone else.\n- In my experience, when you're doing programming work on your own local machine, you mostly just care about the \"owner\" permissions because that's usually you. Here are some full examples:\n  - `-rwxrwxrwx`: A file where everyone can do everything\n  - `-rwxr-xr-x`: A file where everyone can read and execute, but only the owner can write\n  - `drwxr-xr-x`: A directory where everyone can read (`ls` the contents) and execute (`cd` into it), but only the owner can write (modify the contents)\n  - `drwx------`: A directory where only the owner can read, write and execute\n- The [chmod command](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=c-chmod-command) lets you change the permissions of a file or directory. It's short for \"change mode\" (I wish it was called \"change permissions\", but alas).\n- The `ls` command has a `-l` option (lowercase \"L\") that will print out the permissions of each file and directory in long format. Run this command inside the `worldbanc/private` directory:\n\n```bash\nls -l\n```\n\n- Change the permissions of the `private` directory and all of its contents so that:\n  - The owner can read, write, and execute\n  - The group can do nothing\n  - Others can do nothing\n\n```bash\nchmod -R u=rwx,g=,o= DIRECTORY\n```\n\n- In the command above, `u` means \"user\" (aka \"owner\"), `g` means \"group\", and `o` means \"others\". The `=` means \"set the permissions to the following\", and the `rwx` means \"read, write and execute\". The `g=` and `o=` mean \"set group and other permissions to nothing\". The `-R` means \"recursively\", which means \"do this to all of the contents of the directory as well\".\n- Executables\n  - You're probably familiar with the idea of reading and writing files. But what about executing them? Executable files are just programs that you can run on your computer.\n  - Files with a `.sh` extension are [shell scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script). They're just text files that contain shell commands. You can run a file in your shell by just typing its filepath.\n  - Interestingly, if the program is in the current directory (in this example, the `mydir` directory), you need to prefix it with `./`:\n\n```bash\n./program.sh\n```\n\n- can add `chmod -x <script-name>` to remove permissions and `+x` to ad back those permissions.\n\n### Root User:\n\n- \"root\" user is a superuser. It has access to everything on the system and can do anything. When you use the `sudo` command, you're running as the root user (as long as your system hasn't been configured differently).\n- The `sudo` keyword is convenient because it quickly gives you elevated permissions to run a single command.\n- It can also be dangerous because it gives you access to everything. If you run a command with `sudo` that you don't understand, you could do serious damage to your system.\n- For example, `rm` with the `r` and `f` flags run on the root directory (`/`), will **delete all the files on your system**. Don't do that. The `r` flag is for \"recursive\" (delete everything inside) and the `f` flag is for \"force\". Most systems will prevent you from doing this, but if you run it with `sudo`, you've just turned your computer into a very expensive paperweight.\n- So when do you *need* to use `sudo`? `chmod` allows you to change the permissions of any file or directory that you own. But what if you don't own the file or directory? That's where `sudo` is required. Let's change ownership of a directory to see how that works.\n- The `chown` command, which stands for \"change owner\", allows you to change the owner of a file or directory, and it requires root privileges.\n\n### Compiled vs Interpreted Programs:\n\n- A program is just a set of instructions that a computer can execute. We talked about executables in the last lesson, an executable is just a file that contains a program. The words \"program\" and \"executable\" are often used interchangeably. Broadly speaking, there are two types of programs:\n  - Compiled programs\n    - A compiled program is a program that has been converted from human-readable source code into machine code (binary). [Machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code) is a set of instructions that a computer can execute directly: your computer's CPU is hardware that's been designed to execute machine code.\n    - Programming languages like Go, C, and Rust are compiled languages that produce compiled programs.\n  - Interpreted programs:\n    - An interpreted program is a program that is executed by *another* program. The program that executes the interpreted program is called an [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_%28computing%29). The interpreter reads the source code of the interpreted program and executes it.\n    - Programming languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript, are interpreted languages. Your computer needs to have an interpreter installed to run programs written in those languages.\n\n### Shebang:\n\n- That works out-of-the-box for files that are compiled executables. But what about scripts that need to be interpreted by another program? The computer needs to be told what program to use to interpret the file.\n- A [\"shebang\"](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>) is a special line at the top of a script that tells your shell which program to use to execute the file.\n- The format of a shebang is:\n\n```bash\n#! interpreter [optional-arg]\n```\n\n- For example, if your script is a Python script and you want to use Python 3, your shebang might look like this:\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/python3\n```\n\n- For your main shell REPL, as we talked about before:\n- If you're using Ubuntu on WSL, you're probably running a [Bash](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)>) shell.\n- If you're using macOS, you're probably running a [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) shell.\n- If you're running a raw Linux installation, I pray you already know what you're using.\n- To get hand-wavy about it, I want to explain the difference between the 3 shells you're likely to encounter:\n  - `sh` - The Bourne shell. This is the original Unix shell and is [POSIX-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX). It's very basic and doesn't have many quality-of-life features.\n  - `bash` - The Bourne Again shell. This is the most popular shell on Linux. It builds on `sh`, but also has a lot of extra features.\n  - `zsh` - The Z shell. This is the most popular shell on macOS. Like `bash`, it does what `sh` can do, but also has a lot of extra features.\n- Both `zsh` and `bash` are \"sh-compatible\" shells, meaning they can run `.sh` scripts, but they also have extra features that generally make them more pleasant to use. For your purposes, the differences between `zsh` and `bash` are not super significant.\n\n### Shell Configuration:\n\n- Bash and Zsh both have [configuration files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell#Configuration_files) that run automatically each time you start a new shell session. These files are used to set up your shell environment. They can be used to set up aliases, functions, and environment variables.\n- These files are located in your home directory (`~`) and are hidden by default. The `ls` command has a `-a` flag that will show hidden files:\n\n```bash\nls -a ~\n```\n\n### Environment Variables:\n\n- We talked about how you can create and use local variables in your shell:\n\n```bash\nname=\"Lane\"\necho $name\n# Lane\n```\n\n- There is another type of variable called [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable). They are available to *all* programs that you run in your shell.\n- You can view all of the environment variables that are currently set in your shell with the command `env`.\n- If you want to set a variable in your shell, you can use the `export` command:\n\n```bash\nexport NAME=\"Lane\"\n```\n\n- You can then use the variable in your shell, just as before:\n\n```bash\necho $NAME\n# Lane\n```\n\n- The interesting part is that programs and scripts you run in your shell can *also* use that variable:\n- For example, we can create a file called `introduce.sh` with the following contents:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/sh\necho \"Hi I'm $NAME\"\n```\n\n- Then we run it:\n\n```bash\nchmod +x ./introduce.sh\n\n./introduce.sh\n# Hi I'm Lane\n```\n\n### Path:\n\n- There are environment variables that are sort of \"built-in\" to your shell. By \"built-in\" I just mean that different programs and parts of your system know about them and use them. The `PATH` variable is one of those.\n- Why do we care ?\n  - If it weren't for the `PATH`, you'd have to remember the filesystem path of every executable you wanted to run. Instead of just running `ls`, you'd have to run `/bin/ls` (or whatever the location of the `ls` executable is on your system). That's not very convenient.\n  - The `PATH` variable is a list of directories that your shell will look into when you try to run a command. If you type `ls`, your shell will look in each directory listed in your `PATH` variable for an executable called `ls`. If it finds one, it will just run it. If it doesn't, it will give you an error like: \"command not found\".\n\n### Change Your Path:\n\n- A common problem you'll run into in the future is that you install a new program on your machine, but when you try to run it from your terminal, you get an error like:\n\n```bash\n$ my-new-program\n-bash: my-new-program: command not found\n```\n\n- Nine times out of ten, this is because the program is installed in a location that's not in your `PATH` variable. Oftentimes when you install a program using the CLI, it will print a message during the installation process that tells you where the command was installed. **Don't let your eyes glaze over when your terminal prints important messages!** Sometimes you just gotta [rtfm](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/rtfm).\n- To add a directory to your `PATH` without overwriting all of the existing directories, use the `export` command and reference the existing `PATH` variable:\n\n```bash\nexport PATH=\"$PATH:/path/to/new\"\n```\n\n- The `$PATH` part is a reference to the existing `PATH` variable. The `:` separates the existing directories from the new directory (`/path/to/new`) that you're adding.\n- In the last lesson, you changed your `PATH` variable for your current shell session. Trouble is, the next time you restart your shell, it will be reset to its default value. You won't be able to use the `worldbanc` CLI Tool from anywhere unless you change your `PATH` variable *permanently*.\n- The most common way to do this is to add the same `export` command that you used in the last lesson to your shell's configuration file.\n\n### Man:\n\n- The [man](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=m-man-command) command is short for \"manual\". It's a program that displays the manual for other programs.\n- The `man` command will only work for programs that it has a manual for, but most built-in commands and Unix programs are supported. You just pass the name of the command you want to read the manual of as an argument. The most intuitive place to start, of course, is reading the manual-manual:\n\n```bash\n# open the man pages for the 'man' command\nman man\n```\n\n- Most people don't just [read man pages for fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT-fbLFOCy0). More often, the manual is used as a reference to quickly look up usage or special flags.\n- You can search for text in the manual by pressing the `/` key and typing your search, then pressing enter. Let's try to look up what the `-r` flag does for the `ls` command:\n\n```bash\nman ls\n# type '/-r' to start searching\n\n# press 'n' to jump to the next result\n\n# press 'N' to go back if you went too far\n```\n\n### Flags:\n\n- some commands can take [flags](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=names-command-flags). Flags are options that you can pass to a command to change its behavior.\n- For example, the `ls` command can take a `-l` flag to show a \"long\" listing of files:\n\n```bash\nls -l\n```\n\n- The `ls` command can also take a `-a` flag to show \"all\" files, including hidden files:\n\n```bash\nls -a\n```\n\n- You can combine flags:\n\n```bash\nls -al\n```\n\n- Whether or not a command takes flags, and what those flags are, is up to the developer of the command. That said there are some common conventions:\n  - Single-character flags are prefixed with a single dash (.e.g `-a`)\n  - Multi-character flags are prefixed with two dashes (e.g. `--help`)\n  - Sometimes the same flag can be used with a single dash or two dashes (e.g. `-h` or `--help`)\n- Programming languages have functions, and functions take arguments. For example, this Python function takes two arguments: `xp` and `level`:\n\n```python\ndef print_player(xp, level):\n    print(\"Player has\", xp, \"xp and is level\", level)\n```\n\n- In a shell, commands (programs) can also take arguments. For example, the `cd` command takes a single argument (the directory to change to):\n\n```bash\ncd /home/wagslane\n```\n\n- Other commands might take multiple arguments. For example, the `mv` command takes two arguments: the file to move, and the destination to move it to:\n\n```bash\nmv file.txt newfile.txt\n```\n\n- By convention, most production-ready CLI tools have a \"help\" option that will print out some information about how to use the tool. It's usually accessed with one of the following:\n  - `--help` (flag)\n  - `-h` (flag)\n  - `help` (first positional argument)\n\n- The \"help\" output is often easier to parse than a full `man` page. It's usually more of a quick start guide than a full manual.\n\n### Exit Codes:\n\n- [Exit codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status) (sometimes called \"return codes\" or \"status codes\") are how programs communicate back whether they ran successfully or not.\n- `0` is the exit code for success. Any other exit code is an error. 9 times out of 10, if a non-zero exit code is returned (meaning an error) it will be `1`, which is the \"catch-all\" error code.\n- Programs that call other programs use error codes to figure out if execution was successful. For example, if the Boot.dev server program exits with a non-zero exit code, we have another program that will automatically restart it and log the error.\n- In a shell, you can access the exit code of the last program you ran with the question mark (`?`) variable. For example, if you run a program that exits with a non-zero exit code, you can see what it was with the `echo` command:\n\n```bash\nls ~\necho $?\n# 0\n```\n\n```bash\nls /does/not/exist\necho $?\n# 1\n```\n\n### Standard Output:\n\n- You might not even know it yet, but you're already a pro at using standard output. You've been using it since you started the first exercise in this course.\n- [\"Standard Output\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_output_%28stdout%29), usually called \"standard out\" or \"stdout\", is the default place where programs print their output. It's just a stream of data that prints to your terminal, but we'll talk later about how it can be redirected to other places.\n- All programming languages have a simple way to print to stdout. In Python, it's the `print` function:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Hello world\")\n# Hello world\n```\n\n### Standard Error:\n\n- [\"Standard Error\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_%28stderr%29), usually called \"stderr\", is the same thing as standard output, but for error messages. It's a stream completely separate from stdout so that you can redirect it to a different place if need be, but by default, it prints to your terminal just like stdout.\n- ou can redirect stdout and stderr to different places using the `>` and `2>` operators. `>` redirects stdout, and `2>` redirects stderr.\n- Redirect stdout to a file\n\n```bash\necho \"Hello world\" > hello.txt\ncat hello.txt\n# Hello world\n```\n\n- Redirect stderr to a file\n\n```bash\ncat doesnotexist.txt 2> error.txt\ncat error.txt\n# cat: doesnotexist.txt: No such file or directory\n```\n\n### Standard In:\n\n- If there's a standard output, there must be a standard input, right?\n- [\"Standard Input\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_input_%28stdin%29), usually called \"standard in\" or \"stdin\", is the default place where programs *read* their input. It's just a stream of data that programs can read from as they run.\n- All programming languages have a simple way to read from stdin. In Python, it's the `input` function:\n\n```python\n# execution stops until the user types\n# something (in this case \"Lane\") and presses enter\nname = input(\"What is your name? \")\n\nprint(\"Hello,\", name)\n# Hello, Lane!\n```\n\n### Piping:\n\n- One of the most beautiful things about the shell is that you can [pipe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29) the output of one program into the input of another program. With this one simple concept, you can run incredibly powerful automation tasks.\n- The pipe operator is `|`. It's the character that looks like a vertical line. It's usually on the same key as the backslash (`\\`) above the enter key. The pipe operator takes the stdout of the program on the left and \"pipes\" it into the stdin of the program on the right.\n\n```bash\necho \"Have you heard the tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?\" | wc -w\n# 10\n```\n\n- However, instead of that text being sent to your terminal, the pipe operator pipes it into the `wc` (word count) command. The `wc` command counts the number of words in the input it receives. The `-w` flag tells `wc` to only count words.\n\n### Interrupt:\n\n- Sometimes a program will get stuck and you'll want to stop it. Common reasons for this are:\n  - You made a typo in the command and it's not doing what you want\n  - It's trying to access the internet but you're not connected\n  - It's processing too much data and you don't want to wait for it to finish\n  - There is a bug in the program causing it to hang\n- In these cases, you can stop the program by pressing `ctrl + c`. This sends a \"SIGINT\" signal to the program, which tells it to stop.\n\n### Kill:\n\n- Sometimes a program is in such a bad state (or is so malicious) that it doesn't respond to the `SIGINT`, in which case the best option is to use another shell session (new terminal window) to manually [kill](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.3?topic=k-kill-command) the program.\n\n```bash\nkill PID\n```\n\n- `PID` stands for \"process ID\". Every process that's running on your machine has a unique ID. The [ps](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/3.1.0?topic=jobs-using-ps-command), \"process status\" command can be used to list the processes running on your machine, and their IDs:\n\n```bash\nps aux\n```\n\n- The \"aux\" options just mean \"show all processes, including those owned by other users, and show extra information about each process\".\n\n### Unix Philosophy:\n\n- The [Unix Philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy) is a simple set of principles that have guided the development of Unix-like operating systems for decades. It can be summarized as:\n  1.  Write programs that do one thing and do it well.\n      1. why programs like `ls`, `grep`, and `less` exist. They do one thing, and they do it well. They don't try to do too much.\n      2. `ls` lists files and directories\n      3. `grep` searches for text\n      4. `less` displays tex\n  2.  Write programs to work together.\n  - Because, at least according to the Unix Philosophy, programs should do one thing and do it well, it's easy to write programs that work together. For example, you can use `grep` to search for text in a file, and then pipe the output of `grep` into `less` to display the results interactively:\n\n```bash\ngrep \"hello\" some_file.txt | less\n```\n\n    3. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.\n    \tThis point is more the \"how\" of the previous point. Programs work together easily when they all use the same interface: text streams. A text stream is just a sequence of characters that can be read or written sequentially. In other words, a text stream is just text.\n\n    This hearkens back to the point we talked about at the beginning of this course: the shell is a command-line (text) interface. Text-based interfaces are much more powerful and extensible than graphical interfaces. That's why developers have been using them for decades, and why what we can do with them looks like magic to the uninitiated.\n\n### Package Manager:\n\n- When you type a command like `apt install neovim`, the package manager will:\n  1.  Check to see if the package is already installed.\n  2.  If it's not installed, it will download the package from a repository.\n  3.  It will install the package on your computer.\n  4.  It will install any dependencies that the package needs to run.\n  5.  It will (hopefully) add the package to your PATH if it should be there.\n- Good package managers keep track of what packages you have installed, and what versions of those packages you have installed. They keep your filesystem nice and tidy, making sure you haven't installed 10 different instances of the same package or application.\n",

    "content": "\n### Primer:\n\n- A data intensive application is typically built from standard building blocks that provide commonly needed functionality. Eg:\n  - Store data so that they,or another application, can find it again later -> _(databases)_.\n  - Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads -> _(caches)_.\n  - Allow users to search data by keyboard of filter it in various ways -> _(search indexes)_.\n  - Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously -> _(steam processing)_.\n  - Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data -> _(batch processing)_.\n\n- There are many database systems with different characteristics, because different applications have different requirements. There are various approaches to caching, several ways of building search indexes, and so on. When building an application, we still need to figure out which tools and which approaches are the most appropriate for the task at hand.\n\n### Thinking about Data Systems:\n\n- Many new tools for data storage and processing have emerged in recent years. They are optimized for a variety of different use caes, and they no longer neatly into traditional categroies.\n  - Eg: datastores that are also used as message queues(Redis), and there are message queues with database-like durability gurantees (Apache Kafka). Boundaries between the cateories are becoming blurred.\n\n- Increasingly many applications now have such demanding or wide-ranging requirments that a single tool can no longer meet all of its data processing and storage needs. Instead , he work is broken down into tasks that can be performed efficiently on a single tool, and those different tools are stitched together using application code.\n  - Eg: If we have an application-managed caching layer(Memcached), or a full-text search server(ElasticSearch), seperate from your main database, it is normally the application code's responsibility to keep those caches and indexes in sync with the main db.\n\n- When we combine several tools in order to provide a service, the service's API usually hides those implementations details from clients.Now we have essentially created a new , special-purpose data system from smaller, general-purpose components.\n\n### Factors Influencing Design of a Data System:\n\n- Many factors that may influence the design of a data system, including the skills and experience of the people involved, legacy system dependencies, the timescale for delivery, our organization's tolerance of different kinds of risk.\n\n- We focus on 3 concerns that are important in most software systems:\n  - _Reliability_ -> System should continue to work correctly(performing the correct function at the desired level of performance) even in the face of adversity.\n  - _Scalability_ -> As the system grows(in data volumes, traffic volumes, or complexity), there should be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth.\n  - _Maintainibility_ -> Over time, many different people will work on the system and they should all be able to work on it productively.\n\n### Reliability:\n\n- Everybody has a intuitive idea of what it means for something to be reliable or unreliable. For software , typically:\n  - The application performs the function that the user expected.\n  - It can tolerate the user making mistakes or using the software in unexpected ways.\n  - Its performance is good enough for the required use case, under the expected load and data volume.\n  - The system pervens any unauthorized access and abuse.\n\n- Things that can go wrong are called faults, and systems that anticipate faults and can cope with them are called as fault-tolerant or resilient. A fault is usually defined as one component of the system deviating from its spec, whereas a failure is when the system as a whole stops providing the required service to the user.\n\n- It is impossible to reduce the probability of a fault to zero; therefore it is usually best to design fault-tolerance mechanism that prevents faults from causing failures.\n\n- Counterintuitively, many critical bugs are actually due to poor error handling, by deliberately inducing faults, we ensure that the fault-tolerance machinery is continually exercised and tested, which can incease our confidence that faults will be handled correctly when they occur naturally.Eg: Choas Monkey from Netflix.\n\n### Hardware Faults:\n\n- Hard Disks crash, RAM becomes faults, power grid has a blackout,someone unplugs wrong network cable. Anyone who has worked with large datacents, can tell that this happens all he time when we have a lot of machines.\n\n- Hard disks are reported as having a mean time to failure(MTTF) of about 10-50 years. Thus,on storage clsuter with 10k disks, we should expect on avg one disk to die per year.\n\n- First reponse:\n  - add redundancy to the individual hardware component in order to reduce the failure rate of the system. Disks may be set up in a RAID confiuration, servers may have dual power supplies and hot-swappable CPUs and datacenters may have battries and diesel generators for backup power.\n\n- However , as data volumes and application's computing demands have increased, more application have begun using larger number of machines, which proportionally increases the rate of hardware faults. Moreoever, in some cloud platrofmrs like AWS it is fairly common for vitual machine instances to become unavailable without warning, as the platforms are designed to priorize flexibility and elasticity over single-machine reliablity.\n\n- Move towards a system that can tolerate the loss of entire machines, by usin software fault-tolerance techniques in preference or in addition to hardware redundancy. Such systems also have operational advantages: a single-server system requires planned downtime if we need to reoot the machine, whereas a system that can tolerate machine failure can be patched one node at a time, without downtime of the entire system.\n\n### Software Errors:\n\n-\n",

    "content": "\n### Console:\n\n- \"console\" is a panel that displays important messages, like errors or the text output of a program. If we want to see what's happening in our code, we need to print it to the console by using the `print()` function.\n\n### What is Code:\n\n- What is Code?\n  - Code is a just a series of instructions for a computer to follow one after another. Programs can have a lot of instructions.\n  - Code runs in order, starting at the top of the program.\n\n### Syntax:\n\n- Syntax is jargon for valid code that the computer can understand.\n- The rules for how expressions and statements should be structured in languge can also be called as syntax.\n- Syntax errors aren't the only kind of problems that you can run into when coding:\n  - - **A bug in your logic**. Your code is *valid*, and will *run*, but it does something unexpected.\n  - **It's too slow**. Your code is *valid* and does *what's expected*, but it does it slowly\n\n### Variables:\n\n- [Variables](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/variables.html) are how we *store* data as our program runs.\n- A \"variable\" is just a name that we give to a value. For example, we can make a new variable named `my_height` and set its value to `100`:\n\n```py\nmy_height = 100\n```\n\n- Or we can define a variable called `my_name` and set it to the text string `\"Lane\"`:\n\n```py\nmy_name = \"Lane\"\n```\n\n- Once we have a variable, we can access its value by using its name.\n- Variables are called \"variables\" because they can hold any value and that value can change (it varies).\n- Negative numbers in Python work the way you probably expect. Just add a minus sign.\n- Python has built-in support for exponents - something most languages require a `math` library for.\n- Plus Equals -> Python makes reassignment easy when doing math. In JavaScript or Go, you might be familiar with the `++` syntax for incrementing a number variable by 1. In Python, we use the `+=` [in-place operator](https://docs.python.org/3/library/operator.html#in-place-operators) instead.\n- As we covered earlier, a `float` is a positive or negative number **with a fractional part**.\n- You can add the letter `e` or `E` followed by a positive or negative integer to specify that you're using [scientific notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation).\n\n```python\nprint(16e3)\n# Prints 16000.0\n\nprint(7.1e-2)\n# Prints 0.071\n```\n\n- Python also allows you to represent large numbers in the decimal format using underscores as the [delimiter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_separator#Digit_grouping) instead of commas to make it easier to read.\n\n```python\nnum = 16_000\nprint(num)\n# Prints 16000\n\nnum = 16_000_000\nprint(num)\n# Prints 16000000\n```\n\n- Logical operators deal with [boolean values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type), `True` and `False`.\n- The logical `and` operator requires that *both* inputs are `True` to return `True`. The logical `or` operator only requires that *at least one* input is `True` to return `True`.\n- The `not` operator reverses the result. It returns `False` if the input was `True` and vice-versa.\n- [Binary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_number) are just \"base 2\" numbers. They work the same way as \"normal\" base 10 numbers, but with two symbols instead of ten.\n- Each `1` in a binary number represents an ever-greater multiple of 2. In a 4-digit number, that means you have the eights place, the fours place, the twos place, and the ones place. Similar to how in decimal you would have the thousands place, the hundreds place, the tens place, and the ones place.\n- We can write an integer in Python using binary syntax using the `0b` prefix.\n- Bitwise operators are similar to logical operators, but instead of operating on boolean values, they apply the same logic to all the bits in a value by column.\n- A `1` in binary is the same as `True`, while `0` is `False`. So really a bitwise operation is just a bunch of logical operations that are completed in tandem by column.\n- Ampersand `&` is the bitwise \"and\" operator in Python. \"And\" is the *name* of the bitwise operation, while ampersand `&` is the *symbol* for that operation.\n- As you may have guessed, the bitwise \"or\" operator is similar to the bitwise \"and\" operator in that it works on binary rather than boolean values. However, the bitwise \"or\" operator \"or\"s the bits together.\n- When coding it's necessary to be able to compare two values. `Boolean logic` is the name for these kinds of comparison operations that always result in `True` or `False`.\n- The operators:\n  - `<` \"less than\"\n  - `>` \"greater than\"\n  - `<=` \"less than or equal to\"\n  - `>=` \"greater than or equal to\"\n  - `==` \"equal to\"\n  - `!=` \"not equal to\"\n- Here are some basic rules with if/else blocks.\n  - You can't have an `elif` or an `else` without an `if`\n  - You *can* have an `else` without an `elif`\n\n### Comments:\n\n- Comments don't do... anything. They are *ignored* by the Python interpreter. That said, they're good for what the name implies: adding comments to your code in plain English (or whatever language you speak).\n- You can use triple quotes to start and end multi-line comments as well.This is useful if you don't want to add the `#` to the start of each line when writing paragraphs of comments.\n- Variable names can *not* have spaces, they're continuous strings of characters.\n  - The creator of the Python language himself, [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), [implores us](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names) to use `snake_case` for variable names. What *is* snake case? It's just a style for writing variable names.\n- | Name        | Code             | Language(s) that recommend it |\n  | ----------- | ---------------- | ----------------------------- |\n  | Snake Case  | `my_hero_health` | Python, Ruby, Rust            |\n  | Camel Case  | `myHeroHealth`   | JavaScript, Java              |\n  | Pascal Case | `MyHeroHealth`   | C#, C++                       |\n  | No Casing   | `myherohealth`   | No one: don't do this         |\n\n### Variable Types:\n\n- Python has several basic [data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type).\n- **Strings**\n  - In programming snippets of text are called \"[strings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq)\". They're lists of characters *strung* together. We create strings by wrapping the text in single quotes or double quotes. That said, **double quotes are preferred**.\n- **Numbers**:\n  - Numbers are *not* surrounded by quotes when they're declared.\n  - **An [integer](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html) is a number without a decimal part**:\n  - **A [float](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) is a number with a decimal part**:\n- **Booleans**:\n  - A [\"Boolean\"](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/bool.html#boolean-objects) (or \"bool\") is a type that can only have one of two values: `True` or `False`. As you may have heard, computers really only use 1's and 0's. These 1's and 0's are just `True/False` boolean values.\n\n### f-strings:\n\n- In Python we can create strings that contain dynamic values with the [f-string](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html#formatted-string-literals) syntax.\n  - - Opening quotes must be preceded by an `f`.\n- Variables within curly brackets have their values \"interpolated\" (injected) into the string.\n- It's just a string with a special syntax.\n\n### NoneType Variable:\n\n- Not all variables have a value. We can make an \"empty\" variable by setting it to [`None`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#None). `None` is a special value in Python that represents the absence of a value. It is *not* the same as zero, False, or an empty string.\n- [NoneType](https://docs.python.org/3/library/types.html#types.NoneType) is *not* the same as a string with a value of \"None\".\n- One usecase is to represent that a value hasn't been determined yet, for example, an uncaptured input.\n\n### Dynamic Typing:\n\n- Python is [dynamically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_and_dynamic_type_checking_in_practice), which means a variable can store any type, and that type can *change*.\n- In almost all circumstances, it's a *bad idea* to change the type of a variable. The \"proper\" thing to do is to just create a new one.\n- Languages that aren't dynamically typed are [statically typed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Static_typing), such as Go (which you'll learn in a later course). In a statically typed language, if you try to assign a value to a variable of the wrong type, an error would crash the program.\n\n### Math With Strings\n\n- When working with strings the `+` operator performs a \"[concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation)\", which is a fancy word that means \"joining two strings\". *Generally speaking, it's better to use string interpolation with `f-strings` over `+` concatenation*.\n\n### Multi-Variable Declaration:\n\n- We can save space when creating many new variables by declaring them on the same line:\n\n```py\nsword_name, sword_damage, sword_length = \"Excalibur\", 10, 200\n```\n\n- Any number of variables can be declared on the same line, and variables declared on the same line *should* be related to one another in some way so that the code remains easy to understand.\n\n### Functions:\n\n- Functions allow us to *reuse* and *organize* code.\n- But we want to *reuse* our code! Why would we want to redo our work? What if we wanted to calculate the area of thousands of circles??? **That's where functions help.**\n- Instead, we can define a new function called `area_of_circle` using the `def` keyword.\n\n```python\ndef area_of_circle(r):\n    pi = 3.14\n    result = pi * r * r\n    return result\n```\n\n- Functions can have multiple parameters (\"parameter\" being a fancy word for \"input\").\n- The name of a parameter doesn't matter when it comes to which values will be assigned to which parameter. It's **position** that matters. The first parameter will become the first value that's passed in, the second parameter is the second value that's passed in, and so on.\n- Some new developers get hung up on the difference between `print()` and `return`.\n- It can be particularly confusing when the test suite we provide simply prints the output of your functions to the console. It makes it *seem* like `print()` and `return` are interchangeable, *but they are not*!\n- `print()` is a function that:\n  1. Prints a value to the console\n  2. Does *not* return a value\n- `return` is a keyword that:\n  1. Ends the current function's execution\n  2. Provides a value (or values) back to the caller of the function\n  3. Does *not* print anything to the console (unless the return value is later `print()`ed)\n\n- Code executes in *order from top to bottom*, so a variable needs to be created before it can be used. That means that if you define a function, you can't call that function until *after* the definition.\n- When no return value is specified in a function, it will automatically return `None`. For example, maybe it's a function that prints some text to the console, but doesn't explicitly return a value.\n- A function can return more than one value by separating them with commas.\n\n```python\ndef cast_iceblast(wizard_level, start_mana):\n   damage = wizard_level * 2\n   new_mana = start_mana - 10\n   return damage, new_mana # return two values\n```\n\n- When calling a function that returns multiple values, you can assign them to multiple variables.\n\n```python\ndmg, mana = cast_iceblast(5, 100)\nprint(f\"Damage: {dmg}, Remaining Mana: {mana}\")\n# Damage: 10, Remaining Mana: 90\n```\n\n- To reiterate, **arguments are the actual values** that go into the function, such as `42.0`, `\"the dark knight\"`, or `True`. **Parameters are the names** we use in the function definition to refer to those values, which at the time of writing the function, can be whatever we like.\n- In Python you can specify a [default](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-parameter) value for a function argument. It's nice for when a function has arguments that are \"optional\". You as the function definer can specify a specific default value in case the caller doesn't provide one.\n\n- A default value is created by using the assignment (`=`) operator in the function signature.\n\n```python\ndef get_greeting(email, name=\"there\"):\n    print(\"Hello\", name, \"welcome! You've registered your email:\", email)\n```\n\n### Scope:\n\n- Scope refers to *where* a variable or function name is available to be used. For example, when we create variables in a function (such as by giving names to our parameters), that data is *not* available outside of that function.\n\n```python\ndef subtract(x, y):\n    return x - y\nresult = subtract(5, 3)\nprint(x)\n# ERROR! \"name 'x' is not defined\"\n```\n\n- So far we've been working in the global scope. That means that when we define a variable or a function, that name is accessible in *every other place* in our program, even within other functions.\n\n### Testing and Debugging:\n\n- A unit test is just an automated program that tests a small \"unit\" of code. Usually just a function or two. The editor will have tabs: the \"main.py\" file containing your code, and the \"main_test.py\" file containing the unit tests.\n- These new unit-test-style lessons will test your code's *functionality* rather than its output. Our tests will call functions in your code with different arguments, and expect certain return values. If your code returns the correct values, you pass. If it doesn't, you fail.\n- There are two reasons for this change:\n  1.  It's more realistic. In the real world, you'll be writing unit tests and running them against your code to make sure it works as expected.\n  2.  You can run and debug your code with `print` statements, and leave those print statements in when you submit. Unlike the output-based lessons, you won't have to remove your `print` statements to pass.\n\n### Debugging:\n\n- When you're working as a professional developer, you'll typically write code on your computer and test it by yourself before it's deployed to users.\n- That first part of the process is called *debugging*. You write some code, run it, and if it doesn't work, you fix the bugs. You repeat this process until you're confident that your code works as expected.\n- A stack trace (or \"traceback\") is a scary-looking error message that the Python interpreter prints to the console when it encounters certain problems. Stack traces are most common (at least for you right now) when you're trying to run invalid Python code.\n\n### Loops:\n\n- Loops are a programmer's best friend. Loops allow us to do the same operation multiple times without having to write it explicitly each time.\n- A *\"for loop\"* in Python is written like this:\n\n```python\nfor i in range(0, 10):\n    print(i)\n```\n\n- The body of a for-loop *must* be indented, otherwise you'll get a syntax error.\n- Python has another type of loop, the `while` loop. It's a loop that continues `while` a condition remains `True`. The syntax is simple:\n\n```python\nwhile 1:\n    print(\"1 evaluates to True\")\n```\n\n### Lists:\n\n- A natural way to organize and store data is in a `List`. Some languages call them \"arrays\", but in Python we just call them lists. Think of all the apps you use and how many of the items in the app are organized into lists.\n- For example:\n  - An X (formerly Twitter) feed is a list of posts\n  - An online store is a list of products\n  - The state of a chess game is a list of moves\n  - This list is a list of things that are lists\n- Lists in Python are declared using square brackets, with commas separating each item:\n\n```python\ninventory = [\"Iron Breastplate\", \"Healing Potion\", \"Leather Scraps\"]\n```\n\n- Sometimes when we're manually creating lists it can be hard to read if all the items are on the same line of code. We can declare the list using multiple lines if we want to.\n- In the world of programming, counting is a bit strange! We don't start counting at `1`, we start at `0` instead.Each item in a list has an index that refers to its spot in the list.\n- Now that we know how to create new lists, we need to know how to access specific items in the list.\n- We access items in a list directly by using their *index*. Indexes start at 0 (the first item) and increment by one with each successive item. The syntax is as follows:\n\n```python\nbest_languages = [\"JavaScript\", \"Go\", \"Rust\", \"Python\", \"C\"]\nprint(best_languages[1])\n# prints \"Go\", because index 1 was provided\n```\n\n- The length of a List can be calculated using the `len()` function.The length of the list is equal to the number of items present. Don't be fooled by the fact that the length is not equal to the index of the last element, in fact, it will always be one greater.\n- We can also change the item that exists at a given index. For example, we can change `Leather` to `Leather Armor` in the `inventory` list in the following way:\n\n```python\ninventory = [\"Leather\", \"Iron Ore\", \"Healing Potion\"]\ninventory[0] = \"Leather Armor\"\n```\n\n- It's common to create an empty list then fill it with values using a loop. We can add values to the end of a list using the `.append()` method:\n\n```python\ncards = []\ncards.append(\"nvidia\")\ncards.append(\"amd\")\n# the cards list is now ['nvidia', 'amd']\n```\n\n- `.pop()` is the opposite of `.append()`. Pop removes the last element from a list and returns it for use. For example:\n\n```python\nvegetables = [\"broccoli\", \"cabbage\", \"kale\", \"tomato\"]\nlast_vegetable = vegetables.pop()\n# vegetables = ['broccoli', 'cabbage', 'kale']\n# last_vegetable = 'tomato'\n```\n\n- While `.pop()` typically removes the last item of a list, it can also be used to remove an item at a specific index. For example, vegetables.pop(1) would remove 'cabbage' from the list. This can be useful when you need to remove items from other positions in your list.\n- Remember that we can [iterate](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/iterate) over all the elements in a list using a loop. For example, the following code will print each item in the `sports` list.\n\n```python\nfor i in range(0, len(sports)):\n    print(sports[i])\n```\n\n- Python has *the most elegant* syntax for iterating directly over the items in a list without worrying about index numbers. If you don't need the index number you can use the following syntax:\n\n```python\ntrees = ['oak', 'pine', 'maple']\nfor tree in trees:\n    print(tree)\n# Prints:\n# oak\n# pine\n# maple\n```\n\n- The built-in [float()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) function can create a numeric floating point value of negative infinity. Because *every value* will be greater than negative infinity, we can use it to help us accomplish our goal of finding the max value.\n\n```python\nnegative_infinity = float(\"-inf\")\npositive_infinity = float(\"inf\")\n```\n\n- The modulo operator is the percent sign: `%`. It's important to recognize modulo is *not* a percentage though! That's just the symbol we're using.\n\n```python\nremainder = 8 % 3\n# remainder = 2\n```\n\n- Python makes it easy to slice and dice lists to work only with the section you care about. One way to do this is to use the simple slicing operator, which is just a colon `:`.\n- With this operator, you can specify where to start and end the slice, and how to step through the original list. List slicing returns a *new list* from the existing list.\n- The syntax is as follows:\n\n```python\nmy_list[ start : stop : step ]\n```\n\n- We can also omit various sections (\"start\", \"stop\", or \"step\"). For example, `numbers[:3]` means \"get all items from the start up to (but not including) index 3\". `numbers[3:]` means \"get all items from index 3 to the end\".\n\n```python\nnumbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nnumbers[:3] # Gives [0, 1, 2]\nnumbers[3:] # Gives [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n```\n\n- only using the step section :\n\n```python\nnumbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nnumbers[::2] # Gives [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\n```\n\n- Negative indices count from the end of the list. For example, `numbers[-1]` gives the last item in the list, `numbers[-2]` gives the second last item, and so on.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\nnumbers[-3:] # Gives [7, 8, 9]\n```\n\n- Concatenating two lists (smushing them together) is easy in Python, just use the `+` operator.\n\n```python\ntotal = [1, 2, 3] + [4, 5, 6]\nprint(total)\n# Prints: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n- Checking whether a value exists in a list is also really easy in Python, just use the `in` keyword.\n\n```python\nfruits = [\"apple\", \"orange\", \"banana\"]\nprint(\"banana\" in fruits)\n# Prints: True\n```\n\n- Python has a built-in keyword [del](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#the-del-statement) that deletes items from objects. In the case of a list, you can delete specific indexes or entire slices.\n\n```python\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\n# delete the fourth item\ndel nums[3]\nprint(nums)\n# Output: [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\n# delete the second item up to (but not including) the fourth item\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\ndel nums[1:3]\nprint(nums)\n# Output: [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\n\n# delete all elements\nnums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]\ndel nums[:]\nprint(nums)\n# Output: []\n```\n\n### Tuples:\n\n- [Tuples](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-tuple) are collections of data that are ordered and unchangeable. You can think of a tuple as a `List` with a fixed size. Tuples are created with round brackets:\n\n```python\nmy_tuple = (\"this is a tuple\", 45, True)\nprint(my_tuple[0])\n# this is a tuple\nprint(my_tuple[1])\n# 45\nprint(my_tuple[2])\n# True\n```\n\n- While it's typically considered bad practice to store items of different types in a List, it's not a problem with Tuples. Because they have a fixed size, it's easy to keep track of which indexes store which types of data.\n- Tuples are often used to store very small groups (like 2 or 3 items) of data. For example, you might use a tuple to store a dog's name and age.\n- You can easily assign the values of a tuple to variables using unpacking.\n\n```python\ndog = (\"Fido\", 4)\ndog_name, dog_age = dog\nprint(dog_name)\n# Fido\nprint(dog_age)\n# 4\n```\n\n- There is a special case for creating single-item tuples. You must include a comma so Python knows it's a tuple and not regular parentheses.\n- Check if list is empty:\n\n```python\n if not list_name:\n\t ...\n```\n\n- reverse a list:\n\n```python\nlist_name[::-1]\n```\n\n- The `.split()` method in Python is called on a string and returns a list by splitting the string based on a given delimiter. If no delimiter is provided, it will split the string on whitespace. Here's a quick example:\n\n```python\nmessage = \"hello there sam\"\nwords = message.split()\nprint(words)\n# Prints: [\"hello\", \"there\", \"sam\"]\n```\n\n- The `.join()` method is called on a delimiter (what goes between all the words in the list), and takes a list of strings as input.\n\n```python\nlist_of_words = [\"hello\", \"there\", \"sam\"]\nsentence = \" \".join(list_of_words)\nprint(sentence)\n# Prints: \"hello there sam\"\n```\n\n### Dictionaries:\n\n- [Dictionaries](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries) in Python are used to store data values in `key` -> `value` pairs. Dictionaries are a great way to store groups of information.\n\n```python\n# use curly braces\n# add key-value pairs\ncar = {\n  \"brand\": \"Tesla\",\n  \"model\": \"3\",\n  \"year\": 2019\n}\n```\n\n- Because dictionaries rely on unique keys, you can't have two of the same key in the same dictionary. If you try to use the same key twice, the first value will simply be overwritten.\n- A value is retrieved from a dictionary by specifying its corresponding key in square brackets. The square brackets look similar to indexing into a list.\n- You don't need to create a dictionary with values already inside. It is common to create a blank dictionary then populate it later using dynamic values. The syntax is the same as getting data out of a key, just use the assignment operator (`=`) to give that key a value.\n\n```python\nplanets = {}\nplanets[\"Earth\"] = True\nplanets[\"Pluto\"] = False\nprint(planets[\"Pluto\"])\n# Prints False\n```\n\n- If you try to set the value of a key that already exists, you'll end up just updating the value of that key.\n- You can delete existing keys using the `del` keyword.\n\n```python\nnames_dict = {\n    \"jack\": \"bronson\",\n    \"jill\": \"mcarty\",\n    \"joe\": \"denver\"\n}\n\ndel names_dict[\"joe\"]\n\nprint(names_dict)\n# Prints: {'jack': 'bronson', 'jill': 'mcarty'}\n```\n\n- Notice that if you try to delete a key that doesn't exist, you'll get an *error*.\n- If you're unsure whether or not a key exists in a dictionary, use the `in` keyword.\n- We can iterate over a dictionary's keys using the same no-index syntax we used to iterate over the values in a list. With access to the dictionary's keys, we also have access to their corresponding values.\n\n```python\nfruit_sizes = {\n    \"apple\": \"small\",\n    \"banana\": \"large\",\n    \"grape\": \"tiny\"\n}\n\nfor name in fruit_sizes:\n    size = fruit_sizes[name]\n    print(f\"name: {name}, size: {size}\")\n```\n\n- As of Python version `3.7`, dictionaries are *ordered*. In Python `3.6` and earlier, dictionaries were *unordered*.\n- Because dictionaries are ordered, the items have a defined order, and that order will *not* change.\n- Unordered means that the items do *not* have a defined order, so you couldn't refer to an item by using an index.\n\n### Sets:\n\n- [Sets](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets) are *like* Lists, but they are *unordered* and they guarantee *uniqueness*. Only *ONE* of each value can be in a set.\n\n```python\nfruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'grape'}\nprint(type(fruits))\n# Prints: <class 'set'>\n\nprint(fruits)\n# Prints: {'banana', 'grape', 'apple'}\n```\n\n- add :\n\n```python\nfruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'grape'}\nfruits.add('pear')\nprint(fruits)\n# Prints: {'banana', 'grape', 'pear', 'apple'}\n```\n\n- Because the empty bracket `{}` syntax creates an empty dictionary, to create an *empty* set, you need to use the `set()` function.\n\n```python\nfruits = set()\nfruits.add('pear')\nprint(fruits)\n# Prints: {'pear'}\n```\n\n- Iterate(order not guranteed):\n\n```python\nfruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'grape'}\nfor fruit in fruits:\n   print(fruit)\n   # Prints:\n   # banana\n   # grape\n   # apple\n```\n\n- [Sets](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets) are *like* Lists, but they are *unordered* and they guarantee *uniqueness*. Only *ONE* of each value can be in a set.\n\n```python\nfruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'grape'}\nprint(type(fruits))\n# Prints: <class 'set'>\n\nprint(fruits)\n# Prints: {'banana', 'grape', 'apple'}\n```\n\n- Removing Values:\n\n```python\nfruits = {'apple', 'banana', 'grape'}\nfruits.remove('apple')\nprint(fruits)\n# Prints: {'banana', 'grape'}\n```\n\n- With sets ,we can also do some set operations like add,difference etc:\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_ids(first_ids, second_ids):\n    first_ids_set = set(first_ids)\n    second_ids_set = set(second_ids)\n    return list(first_ids_set.difference(second_ids_set))\n```\n\n### Exceptions:\n\n- You've probably encountered some errors in your code from time to time if you've gotten this far in the course. In Python, there are two main kinds of distinguishable errors.\n  - syntax errors\n  - exceptions\n- You probably know what these are by now. A syntax error is just the Python interpreter telling you that your code isn't adhering to proper Python syntax.\n\n```python\nthis is not valid code, so it will error\n```\n\n- Even if your code has the right syntax, however, it may still cause an error when an attempt is made to execute it. Errors detected during execution are called \"exceptions\" and can be handled gracefully by your code. You can even raise your own exceptions when bad things happen in your code.\n- Python uses a [try-except](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#handling-exceptions) pattern for handling errors.\n\n```python\ntry:\n  10 / 0\nexcept Exception:\n  print(\"can't divide by zero\")\n```\n\n- `try` block is executed until an exception is raised or it completes, whichever happens first. In this case, an exception is raised because division by zero is impossible. The `except` block is only executed if an exception is raised in the `try` block.\n- If we want to access the data from the exception, we use the following syntax:\n\n```python\ntry:\n  10 / 0\nexcept Exception as e:\n  print(e)\n\n# prints \"division by zero\"\n```\n\n- `try` block is executed until an exception is raised or it completes, whichever happens first. In this case, a \"divide by zero\" error is raised because division by zero is impossible. The `except` block is only executed if an exception is raised in the `try` block. It then exposes the exception as data (`e` in our case) so that the program can handle the exception gracefully without crashing.\n- Errors are *not* something to be scared of. Every program that runs in production is expected to manage errors on a constant basis. Our job as developers is to handle the errors gracefully and in a way that aligns with our user's expectations.An *error* or *exception* is raised when something bad happens, but as long as our code handles it as users expect it to, it's *not* a bug. A bug is when code behaves in ways our users don't expect it to.\n- As a rule of thumb, you do not want to catch exceptions you raise within the same function block, for example:\n\n```python\n# don't do this\ndef craft_sword(metal_bar):\n    try:\n        if metal_bar == \"bronze\":\n            return \"bronze sword\"\n        if metal_bar == \"iron\":\n            return \"iron sword\"\n        if metal_bar == \"steel\":\n            return \"steel sword\"\n        raise Exception(\"invalid metal bar\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n- Instead, the caller should handle any potential error by wrapping the function call within a try/except block.\n\n```python\n# do this\ntry:\n    craft_sword(\"gold bar\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n\n- Important to understand is that there are different types of exceptions and we can handle them differently depending on the situation. Some exceptions are more specific, like `ZeroDivisionError` or `IndexError`, and some are more general, like the base `Exception`.\n- When handling exceptions, it’s important to catch the **most specific ones** first, because Python stops checking once it finds a matching exception handler. If you catch a more general Exception first, any specific errors will never get handled individually.\n- For example:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    nums = [0, 1]\n    print(nums[2])\nexcept Exception:\n    print(\"An error occurred\")\nexcept IndexError:\n    print(\"Index error\")\n```\n\n- As seen in the example, you can also access the error using `as`, like this:\n\n```python\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(e)\n```\n",
