# Functional Programming in Python 🐍🚀
(chatgpt generated)
This is my personal journey toward mastering **functional programming in Python** with the goal of approaching the level of understanding you'd expect from a seasoned Haskell developer — but in Python.

## 📆 Weekly Plan

| Week | Focus                            | Topics Covered                                      |
|------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 01   | Core Functional Concepts         | map, filter, lambda, functools, itertools           |
| 02   | Immutability & Pure Functions    | Pure functions, immutable data, recursion           |
| 03   | Compositional Thinking           | Function composition, pipelines, monads, toolz      |
| 04   | Advanced Functional Techniques   | Tail recursion, parser combinators, ADTs            |
| 05   | Real-World Projects              | DSL, Lisp interpreter, rule engine                  |

## 🛠️ Libraries Used

- `functools`
- `itertools`
- [`toolz`](https://toolz.readthedocs.io)
- [`returns`](https://github.com/dry-python/returns) *(optional for type-safe monads)*

## 📚 Inspirations

- [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
- [Category Theory for Programmers](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf)
- SICP concepts, re-implemented in Python

## ✅ Goal

By the end of this, I want to be able to:
- Think in pipelines and composable pure functions
- Emulate monads, functors, and immutability in Python
- Apply FP to real-world projects
