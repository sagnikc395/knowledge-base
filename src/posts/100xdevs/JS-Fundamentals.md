- course notes for 100xDev Javascript Fundamentals.
-  why languages ?
	- computer has ram and storage.
	- whenever we have application locally resides in the SSD
	- when we run something -- it runs in RAM
	- the current things in RAM, other things in SSD 
	- what exactly goes to RAM? Some hardware and circuits - machine at the lowest level only understands a bunch of numbers 
	- RAM doesnt understand programming languages -> represented by 0s and 1s.
	- Using something called compilers -> high level code , compiled to 0s and 1s. by the compiler. Much easier to run for loops, 0s and 1s. High level need of a programming language.
	- Every language has a compiler which convers the developer code into binary.
	- Compilers -> converts high level developer code into binary
- Interpreted vs compiled languages 
	- C++ is compiled -> compiles the code into binary by the compiler
	- JS is interpreted directly. No specific compilation step
	- Goes line by line ; doesn't worry about high level compilation of the whole thing
		-  usually goes line by line 
		- can run partially if the error comes later
- why JS >> Other languages in some use-cases
	- 
- Strict vs Dynamic Languages
- Single Threaded nature of JS 
- Simple Primitives in JS(number, strings, booleans)
- Complex Primitives in JS(arrays, objects)
- Functions in JS
- Practise problem solving 
- Callback functions, event loop, callback queue, asynchronous programming 
- Callback Hell and Promises
