- Main Idea: **have an approach and taking ownership while building applications** 
- AI Era
	- AI can replicate nearly everything 
	- intense debate online about whether human engineers are still necessary
	- what is the distinction b/w project and a product.
		- edge cases 
		- micro interactions 
		- performance 
	- other factors:
		- thoughtful defaults
		- do it now mindset
- winterfell
	- generates contract for web3 applications using prompts 
	- similar like lovable.
- edge cases 
	- added templates for people who dont want to create contract from scratch.
	- if there is already a chat existing, ask the user for a new chat, instead appending everything (prompt + template) in a single chat.
	- learning: think of all the edge cases in the application and what all features you wanna support with your own constraints.
	- users might wanna export the codebase to your Github 
		- users choosing repo name is already existing -> added a small ui change to show it is not available.
		- if available show a green sign -> users are able to know , users will come back -> small retention things required to launch it to the market.
	- anything that we ship should have a purpose, otherwise it will drive customers away.
	- while making features , always things of these small edge cases that can happen.
- thoughtful defaults
	- while building, make the thing as much polished as we can.
	- think of it as the users will come into the picture, they will use it and what all interactions will come into the picture.
	- think of everything as intention of building and shipping a product 
	- take ownership and make your product e2e ready.
	- don't leave and make things only functional - focus on experience also
- ui/ux and dx 
	- best resourceful application, should be functional, maintainable, can be itered fast and should be useful for others.
	- have clean distinctions on what we are building.
	- not only ui/ux , but also write clean code -> better dx lets you debug and maintain code easier.
- project/ product 
	- project
		- application which was built to just showcase its purpose
		- bugs and improvements kept to solve later.
		- shortcuts taken to hit the deadline
	- product
		- an application which is being built in a way that real users will kick in 
		- take the ownership of quality at every level. just don't ship code that "works" - refine it until it truly serves users well.
		- think in terms of scalability, maintenance and evolution.
- understand the user journey map 
	- always place the user journey maps before writing a single line of code
	- onboarding / entry point 
		- winterfell -> primarily entered through developer channels.
		- core audience to developers
		- require sign in via github -> primary authenticated 
			- want the code in their local github 
		- non -developer users , Google Sign in as fallback authentication.
	- discovery
		- aim to deliver by exploring key features through clear and intuitive navigation.
	- playground 
		- user experience though interaction with the site.
		- needed to make the playground page the most polished.
		- the core of the product -> shouldn't send a bad signal -> remove rigidness and to support the site.
		- all the behaviors should work like a charm.
	- retention and trust signals
		- if users feel stuck or annoyed, they wont use it again.
		- try to take reviews 
		- the repository creation small ui fix -> red if already exists or green if can be created 
			- think of small edge cases like this , to make ux better.
- iceberg principle : 
	- small feature like adding collaborator actually hides several imp considerations beneath the surface.
	- difference bw project perspective and production perspective.
- taste is not personal preference 
	- you can always know a good website from a bad one.
	- how to develop good taste ?
		- not only browse websites from users perspective , but also from a developer's eye
		- eg: gumroad and its neobrutalist theme of website.
		- train yourself with intent , it can't be imposed or downloaded.
	- inspiration
		- scroll products not products 
			- eg: huly.io -> discord but for teams 
			- eg: cal.com 
			- eg: aceternity.ui
			- eg: reactbits 
		- decode -> understand their behaviour 
		- internalize -> rebuild those interactions 
		- refine -> remove the unneccessary clogs and make the application own it, even if it is copied 
- "learn to write clean code, not just UIs. and learn to write it with bare hands"
- "in a world of scarcity, we treasure tools, in a world of abundance, we treasure taste"
