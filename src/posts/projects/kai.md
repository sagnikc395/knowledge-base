- Objective: building an app that can help us build other apps.
- what does an ai agent do ?
	- program that we are building is a CLI tool that 
		- accepts a coding task
		- chooses from a set of predefined functions to work on the task , like:
			- scan the files in a directory 
			- read a file's contents 
			- overwrites a file's contents
			- execute the python interpreter on a file 
	- repeats step2 until the task is complete (or it fails, which is also possible)
- Goals Of Project:
	- Understand how the AI tools work under the hood
	- Writing a CLI tool with Python
	- Using a pre-trained LLM to build an agent from scratch.
	- How to make better DX for developers to use these tools and how to use it.
- Gemini is an LLM. 
	- Given it a prompt , it will give you back an text , that it believes is the answer.
- Tokens:
	- Tokens are the currency of LLMs.
	- The way LLMs measure how much text they have to process.
	- Roughly 4 letters for most models.
- LLM APIs aren't typically used in a "one-shot" manner , as we need to keep the context of the conversation that is happening 
	- When we are talking to ChatGPT , the conversation has a history, and , if we keep track of that history ,then with each new prompt, the model can see the entire conversation and respond with the larger context of the conversation.
- Most importantly, each message in the conversation has a "role".
	 - eg: user role vs model / agent role 
- for testing and building our agent to see if it works properly , added a calculator building app e2e.
 - capabilities of the agent
	 - ability to read the contents from files
		 - more specifically 
	- built a guardrail to read the files in the guarded directory so the LLM doesnt run amok.
- getting the contents of a file
	- return the file contents as a string , or perhaps a error string if something went wrong.
	- as always safely scope to this to the specific working directory.
