### Introduction  
- field is moving really really fast 
- understand how modern AI engineering is done 
- tools , use cases , agents ,skills - subset of buzz words - a lot of other things are present.
- ask lots of intuitive questions during interviews and also learn about the interview process as well
- understand how LLMs actually work 
- research also involves implementing a lot of stuff that you work with daily 
- things to do 
	- basic python 
	- have a colab account ready 
	- look at different models available in the market today and explore them 
	- lot of models in the market -> try to also look at os models like qwen, deepseek etc.
		- how different they are from other models.
- free stuff we can try:
	- cli tools people are getting from that 
	- opencode 
	- gemini cli 
- building and being good with the fundamentals is more important than doing a phd now.
- applied ai 
	- using existing tools, how to make things that are better to use and to find new applications that can be built on top of them.
- what are some good projects ?
	- dealing with los of data 
	- lots of context, lots of data
	- how we pass the data to the llm 
	- memory and need of something -> mix and match of these
- context engineering 
	- when to use which model 
	- what are the best models 
	- how to switch contexts etc.
- agentic tasks, data pipeling and building webapps on top of a agentic skill and definitely a good way to learn about this 
- go on colab and learn and type everything 
	- theory and learn about things 
	- and what direction we are going towards.
- coding simple transformations and simple blocks of attention 
- go out and try qwen, deepseek , llama on openrouter and find examples on where where these models differ , different guard rails and jailbreaking these open access models.
- what do AI engineers do ?
	- new "backend" engineer
	- pace we are moving is the same thing 
	- every company needs someone who can do this and has become a new completely different field and high time to learn what this tools are 
	- lot of people are vibe coding things and moving fast.
	- can move in 2-3 projects at two times and deliver more than asked for and using these agents much easier to build and deploy faster.
- openrouter and opencode to play around with different models.
