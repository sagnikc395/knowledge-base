- Way to think intelligently how economics work and how policy based things work.
- Microeconomics is the study of how individuals and firms make themselves as well off as possible in the advent of scarcity.
- Strained Optimization -> ind/firms assesing the tradeoffs for the decisions they make and then deciding on the conditions they have.
- how to best way to use limited resources ?
- **Opportunity Cost**
  - notion that every action/ inaction has cost of what you could have done instead ie the action not taken.
  - This is why economics is called the dismal science -> we think its free , but its not.
  - Engineering is the nothing is but the area of constrained optimizations.
  - MIT bought the tools of science into economics and brought modern economics.

### Economics model everything in the area using the concept of demand and supply

- the way that we do it is by building simplified models.
- a model is simply the description of relationship bw 2 or more variables.
- unlike traditional science, economics doesn't have a ground truth i.e fixed laws that must always be applicable - it's more of a social science.
  - for that we study different models.
- basically try to tradeoff 2 goals:
  - tradeoff model
  - parsimonius model ?

### Model: Supply vs Demand

- Adam Smith in 1776 in the book "Wealth of Nations" - laid the foundation stone for modern economics.
- Nothing is more central to life than water, not diamonds (which has purely ceremonial uses)
  - but the price of water is low and the price of diamonds is high
  - how could this be ?
    - the demand for water is much much larger than diamonds.
    - the supply for water is much much low compared that diamonds.
    - can't only think of them in isolation but in conjugation.
- **Market**
  - a place where buyers and sellers coming together to make transactions.
  - ie. think of the traditional markets
  - modern market doesn't work that way.
  - core is there should be buyers and there should be sellers.

  - negative correlation bw price of roses and quantity.
  - why ?
    - because of opportunity cost.
    - more rose, more we have to give up to buy it.
  - the point where supply and demand meets is called the **equilibrium**.
    - supplier willing to sell roses and at which consumers want to pay for them.
    - ie system has come to rest
  - **Opportunity cost of a item in free market is its price.**

### Positive Economics vs Normative Economics

- Positive Economics is the study of how things are.
- Normative Economics is the study of how things should be.
- Economics at work: eBay
  - auctions at scale.
  - standard market existed in 15th century England.
  - showed who wanted the good the most.
  - beautiful feature of free market economics is that it will land in the hand of the people who most want it / higher opportunity cost.
- Eg: someone selling their kidney on eBay starting at 25k USD before eBay shutting it down at 5 million USD.
  - Positive Economics Model:
    - why did the price of Kidney get so high on eBay?
    - the demand for a kidney in free market is gonna be pretty high
    - the supply for a kidney in free market is gonna be pretty low.
  - Normative Economics Model:
    - should we be able to sell a bodypart on ebay ?
    - this isn't just a philosophy question but also a economics queston.
    - many folks die in US because they have less organ supply.
    - if someone who wants a organ is wealthy, and someone who wants money and still function fine on 1 kidney, why shouldnt we let that happen?
      - reason 1: _Market Failures_
        - economics is fundametally a right-wind economics. Ideally you should let the market work on its own.
        - intervention only when:
          - market is not working properly.
          - it would be fine if we go knowlegably go into that
          - but what happens if someone forces their children to give up their kidney.
          - do things against their will.
          - or people who dont understand how dangerous it is.
        - black market comes with inherit unsafe features.
      - reason 2: _equity / fairness_
        - only rich people get access to it.
        - does the equity cause huge inequality on society.
      - reason 3: _underlying structure of economy_:
        - capitalistic model vs a command model.
        - captialistic model
          - in ints purest form lets individual decide what to produce and consume with no interference. purely free market.
          - how ever no such market is pure capitalistic - even US as a market is market driven but governmentally and socially driven.
          - eg: we let GM decide on how many cars it can produce, but we have standards on emission, safety ,regulations ,taxes on gas etc.
          - ie. constrained capitalistic economy -> some setup by govt and some by socialistic model.
        - command model ->
          - germany in world war 2 / soviet russia
          - govt makes all production decisions -> not only who produces and how much it produces.
          - it can ensure that the right good gets produces and it can be distributed with more equity.
          - can't trust the market to do that only the govt can.
          - great argument in theory , but practically doesn't work.
          - its too damn hard to make all those decisions.
