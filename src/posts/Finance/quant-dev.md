## How to Break into the Quant Field

- What the hell is a quant ?
  - Way more at a high level to use math and code to move trading decisions.
  - Quant researchers and quant traders
    - Researchers -> Brain behind the strategies who build and test statistical models that can predict how markets behave and think about quant research like using math to find hidden edges in financial data.
  - Quant Traders
    - The folks that take those models and execute real trades in real time.
    - Its fast, chaotic and all about speed.
    - Constantly optimizing , tweaking models, and making snap decisions.
  - Quant Devs
    - Software Engineers who buiilds the infrastructure and tools that make all this quant magic possible.
    - They are not creating techniques, but they are the reason the strategies work.
- Baseline -> Strong fundamentals in maths, statistics and coding.

- More than half the trading volume are volumentric trading strategies.
  - We are in the code, fulltimers are solving and using maths and code to make decisions to move millions of dollars.

### From Zero to Trading Floor:

- Focus on fundamental math skills.
- Core Set of Classes:
  - Probability
    - Solid math foundations in maths and probability.
    - Stats Course work helps in this.
  - Machine Learning
    - Predict and Adapt
    - Skills that adapt to market roles
    - Can combine math and coding to handle messy data
  - DSA
    - Quant interviews throw followup questions
    - Focus on fundamental questions and why
  - Linear algebra and multivariate calculas
    - optimizing complex strategies for multiple values.
  - Python and C++ are the top choices.
    - They care about how you think , not about the languages quirks.

- Algorithms and Data Structures for the interviews and need to prep on DP and Graphs.

- Think probabilisitcally, optimizations and deep math and coding skills -> like a muscle and start coding.

### How to pass the interviews:

- Complete and follow the Green Book -> A Practical Guide to Quant Finance Interviews.
- Dont flip to the answers -> magic is in the struggle -> need to build the exact model -> use pen and paper
- Add pressure and time yourself -> forces you to think fast -> buiild up layers -> when you want to optimize for speed.
- Master the green book
- How to prep for interviews:
  - SE -> Deep quant skiils + software engineering and curriculum built around quant swe skills -> building
- Applying before you are actually qualified -> throw yourself in the game early.
  - fake it until you make it
  - use your network and connections count.
  - every connection you make
  - take a long short them -> and snipe that ones that you can actually get into.

### your words and behavioural round matters as much.
